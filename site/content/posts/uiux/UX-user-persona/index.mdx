## User persona

A persona represents a certain type of behavior of a real group of people, but is not itself a real individual. 
It was a fictional character that had the characteristics of the client. It is a general image that describes 
a certain way in which a customer interacts with a product or brand.

## 3 main types of Persona in UX

**Proto-persona** is a simple, generic customer portrait based on your own views, thoughts or a synthesis of the 
product team's ideas that have not been verified with research and data collection in practice. This type is 
suitable for use in the stage where basic decisions need to be made or the first steps in the development 
of a user-oriented product.

**Marketing persona** focuses on the purpose, needs of the customer as well as the customer's interest in the product. 
It may include characteristics of shopping propensity, media consumption habits or buying decision context. This 
type of persona will be suitable for determining the potential of the market, the message and the top priorities 
when promoting the product.

**Design persona** helps define what a product or service is and isn't, solves a user's problem, and will be used. Based 
on UX Research, a profile of this type will include the behavior and pain points encountered by users using the product. 
The designer's role is to model behavior into a generic character. This will help them focus their design for a 
certain type of user.

## Steps to create User Persona

1. Identify target groups and select representatives of that group to do research.

2. Do user research (interviews, surveys, etc.). Gather more information to fill the gaps in user knowledge.

3. Turn research results, insights into common characteristics, prepare to create portraits.

4. Compare results to aggregate or group customer records. Create a customer segment chart.
