**Hoisting** is JavaScript’s behavior of moving **declarations** to the top of their scope during the compile phase. This doesn’t mean code is physically moved—JavaScript just *knows* about certain variables and functions before execution starts.

## Variable Hoisting

### `var`

* **Hoisted and initialized to `undefined`**
* Accessible before declaration (but value is `undefined`)
* Function-scoped (not block-scoped)

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

⚠️ This can cause subtle bugs because accessing `a` before assignment doesn’t throw an error.

### `let`

* **Hoisted but NOT initialized**
* Exists in the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** until declared
* Block-scoped

```js
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 10;
```

### `const`

* Same hoisting behavior as `let`
* Must be initialized at declaration
* Block-scoped and cannot be reassigned

```js
console.log(c); // ❌ ReferenceError
const c = 10;
```

✅ `let` and `const` are safer than `var` because they prevent early access.

## Function Hoisting

### Function Declarations

* **Fully hoisted (name + implementation)**
* Can be called before they appear in code

```js
sayHello();

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

✔️ This works because the entire function is hoisted.

### Function Expressions

* Hoisting depends on how they’re declared

#### With `var`

```js
sayHi(); // ❌ TypeError: sayHi is not a function

var sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Hi");
};
```

* Variable is hoisted as `undefined`
* Function body is not hoisted

#### With `let` / `const`

```js
sayHey(); // ❌ ReferenceError

const sayHey = function () {
  console.log("Hey");
};
```

* In TDZ until declaration
* Safer and more predictable

## Quick Comparison

| Declaration          | Hoisted | Initialized | Scope    | Safe to Access Early |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `var`                | ✅       | `undefined` | Function | ⚠️ Yes (but risky)   |
| `let`                | ✅       | ❌           | Block    | ❌                    |
| `const`              | ✅       | ❌           | Block    | ❌                    |
| Function Declaration | ✅       | ✅           | Function | ✅                    |
| Function Expression  | Partial | ❌           | Depends  | ❌                    |
