## 🔹 What is `this`?

In JavaScript, `this` refers to the **execution context** — or **how a function is called**, not where it’s defined.

---

## 🔸 1. **Global Context**
```js
console.log(this); // In browser: window; In Node.js: {}
```

---

## 🔸 2. **Inside a Regular Function**
```js
function show() {
  console.log(this);
}
show(); // In non-strict mode: window (or global), in strict mode: undefined
```

---

## 🔸 3. **Inside an Object Method**
```js
const user = {
  name: "Daniel",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
user.greet(); // "Daniel"
```

> In object methods, `this` refers to the object the method is called on.

---

## 🔸 4. **Arrow Functions & `this`**
```js
const user = {
  name: "Daniel",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
user.greet(); // undefined
```

> Arrow functions **do not bind their own `this`**. They inherit it from the **lexical scope** (i.e. the place they were defined).  
> If defined globally, `this` is the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).

---

## 🔸 5. **Inside Class Methods**
```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  sayHi() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
const p = new Person("Daniel");
p.sayHi(); // "Daniel"
```

> In class methods, `this` refers to the **instance**.

---

## 🔸 6. **In Event Listeners**
```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this); // the button element
});
```

> If you use a regular function in an event listener, `this` refers to the DOM element.  
> If you use an arrow function, `this` will refer to the **outer context**, **not** the element.
