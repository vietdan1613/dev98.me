> *Prototype inheritance is JavaScript’s mechanism where objects delegate property access to other objects through a prototype chain.*

## What Is Prototype Inheritance?

Every JavaScript object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]` (accessible via `__proto__` or `Object.getPrototypeOf()`).

When you access a property:

1. JavaScript looks on the object itself
2. If not found, it looks on the object’s **prototype**
3. This continues up the chain until `null`

This delegation mechanism is **prototype inheritance**.

## The Prototype Chain Explained

```js
const person = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
};

const user = {
  name: "Alice"
};

Object.setPrototypeOf(user, person);

user.greet(); // "Hello"
```

### What happens here?

* `user` does not have `greet`
* JavaScript checks `user.__proto__` → `person`
* Finds `greet` and executes it

That lookup path is the **prototype chain**.

## Constructor Functions & Prototypes

When using constructor functions, JavaScript automatically links objects to a prototype.

```js
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

User.prototype.sayHi = function () {
  console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);
};

const u1 = new User("Bob");
u1.sayHi();
```

Prototype chain:

```
u1 → User.prototype → Object.prototype → null
```

✔️ Methods are shared
✔️ Memory efficient
✔️ Dynamic inheritance

## `Object.prototype` (The Root)

Almost all objects eventually inherit from `Object.prototype`.

```js
u1.toString(); // from Object.prototype
```

This is why methods like `toString`, `hasOwnProperty`, and `valueOf` are available everywhere.

## Why Prototype Inheritance Matters

Prototype inheritance enables:

* Method sharing (better performance)
* Behavior reuse
* Dynamic extension of objects
* Framework patterns (React, Node.js internals)
