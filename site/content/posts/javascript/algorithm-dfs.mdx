> **DFS goes as deep as possible before going back.**

## What is a Graph?

A **graph** is just a collection of **nodes** (also called vertices) and **connections** between them (called edges).
Example:

![example-graph](./imgs/dfs.png 'example-graph')

Graphs can represent:

* Maps
* Networks
* Friendships (like Facebook friends graph)
* Game paths
* And more!

## 🧠 So What is DFS?

**DFS (Depth-First Search)** is a way to explore a graph by going **as deep as possible** down one path *before* backtracking.

Think of it like exploring a maze:

1. Choose a direction.
2. Keep going forward.
3. If you reach a dead-end, go back to the last junction.
4. Try a different path.
5. Repeat until everything is explored.

## 🎨 Visual Thinking

Imagine each node has neighbors. DFS will:

* Visit a node
* Then visit **the first neighbor**
* Then the neighbor of that neighbor
* And so on…

It goes **deep**, not wide.

This is different from BFS (Breadth-First Search), which explores layer by layer.

### 🏁 When to Use DFS?

Use DFS when:
✅ You want to explore **deep paths first**
✅ You need to **detect cycles**
✅ You need to **check if nodes are connected**
✅ You're searching possible solutions (like puzzles)

## Code Example

link: https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/

```js
var canVisitAllRooms = function(rooms) {
  const visited = new Set();

  function dfs(room) {
    if (visited.has(room)) return;

    visited.add(room);

    for (const key of rooms[room]) {
      dfs(key);
    }
  }

  dfs(0);

  return visited.size === rooms.length;
};
```
