To implement a method that lists out the words with the maximum number of occurrences in a paragraph, we can follow these steps:

1. **Split the input paragraph into words**.
2. **Count the frequency of each word** using a dictionary or object.
3. **Identify the maximum frequency**.
4. **Filter and return all words with the maximum frequency**.

### JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
function findMostFrequentWords(paragraph) {
  const words = paragraph.split(' ').map(word => word.toLowerCase());  // Split by space and convert to lowercase
  const wordCount = {};

  // Count the occurrences of each word
  for (const word of words) {
    wordCount[word] = (wordCount[word] || 0) + 1;
  }

  // Find the maximum occurrence count
  let maxCount = 0;
  for (const count of Object.values(wordCount)) {
    maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
  }

  // Collect all words that have the maximum count
  const result = [];
  for (const [word, count] of Object.entries(wordCount)) {
    if (count === maxCount) {
      result.push(word);
    }
  }

  return result;
}

// ✅ Example usage:
const input = "I want to know how to achieve the things I want";
console.log(findMostFrequentWords(input)); // Output: ['to', 'I', 'want']
```

### How It Works:
1. **`split(' ')`**: Splits the input paragraph into an array of words by spaces.
2. **`map(word => word.toLowerCase())`**: Converts each word to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.
3. **`wordCount`**: This object stores the frequency of each word.
4. **`maxCount`**: Tracks the maximum frequency of any word.
5. **Filter**: We collect words that have the maximum frequency and return them.

### Example:

For the input:
```
"I want to know how to achieve the things I want"
```

- Words and their frequencies:
  - `I`: 2
  - `want`: 2
  - `to`: 2
  - `know`: 1
  - `how`: 1
  - `achieve`: 1
  - `the`: 1
  - `things`: 1

- The words with the highest frequency (2 occurrences) are: `["to", "I", "want"]`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of words in the paragraph.  
  - Splitting the paragraph takes O(n).
  - Counting the frequency of each word also takes O(n).
  - Finding the words with the maximum frequency takes O(n) in the worst case.
