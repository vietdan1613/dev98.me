## üî• Core JavaScript (Deep Dive)

1. **Explain event loop and microtasks vs macrotasks. How does `async/await` fit into this model?**
2. **What are closures?** How are they used in memory leaks, module patterns, or callback handlers?
3. **Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`.** When would you intentionally use `var`?
4. **What is hoisting?** How does it affect function expressions and variable declarations?
5. **What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?** How would you implement a deep copy function?
6. **Explain the behavior of `this` in different contexts.** Arrow functions vs normal functions.
7. **What is the difference between `Object.freeze()`, `Object.seal()`, and `Object.preventExtensions()`?**
8. **How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?** How would you polyfill `Object.create()`?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Async Programming

1. **What's the difference between Promises and Observables?** When would you use each?
2. **How would you implement your own `Promise.all()`?**
3. **What's the behavior of `async` functions with error handling?** How would you handle both sync and async errors in a utility?
4. **How would you debounce and throttle user input?** Bonus: implement both.
5. **How would you cancel a fetch request or handle multiple race conditions in JS?**

## üì¶ Performance and Optimization

1. **What causes memory leaks in JS?** How can you detect and prevent them?
2. **How do you optimize rendering in large-scale SPAs?**
3. **How do you lazy-load modules and components in JavaScript apps (without frameworks)?**
4. **What is event delegation and how does it help performance?**
5. **How would you implement virtual scrolling or infinite scroll in a list-heavy UI?**

---

## üîß Code Design & Patterns

1. **Explain the Module Pattern in JavaScript.** How do IIFE and closures relate to it?
2. **When would you use Factory Functions over Classes?**
3. **Explain how Currying and Partial Application work.** Real use cases?
4. **How would you implement a simple pub/sub system (event bus) in vanilla JS?**
5. **What are higher-order functions and how do you use them to write more declarative code?**

---

## üß™ Real-world Code Challenges (You May Be Asked to Solve Live)

- Implement a debounce function.
- Write a deep clone function (without `structuredClone()` or `JSON.parse`).
- Create a memoization wrapper for any expensive function.
- Write a simple `compose()` or `pipe()` utility.
- Implement a `once()` function that runs a callback only once.

## üß† System Thinking & Architecture

1. **How do you design a large-scale JS codebase to remain modular and maintainable?**
2. **How do you handle global state in pure JavaScript without libraries?**
3. **How do you secure frontend JavaScript code from tampering or leaking secrets?**
4. **How do you organize feature flags or A/B tests in a frontend system?**
5. **What are some anti-patterns in large JS projects that you‚Äôve encountered and fixed?**

## Want to Practice?

I can:
- Simulate a mock interview
- Give you coding challenges with test cases
- Walk you through an open-ended architectural system (like a design doc)
