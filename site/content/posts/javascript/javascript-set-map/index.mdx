In modern JavaScript, two powerful built-in data structures are `Set` and `Map`. They are often underutilized by beginners, but mastering them can lead to cleaner and more efficient code â€” especially when solving algorithmic problems like those on LeetCode.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is a `Set`?

A `Set` is a collection of **unique values**. This means no duplicate elements are allowed. It's perfect for when you want to keep track of a group of distinct items.

### âœ… Key Characteristics:

* No duplicate values
* Iteration order is preserved
* Useful for de-duplication and membership checks

### âœ¨ Common Methods:

```js
const mySet = new Set();

mySet.add(1);
mySet.add(2);
mySet.add(2); // duplicate, will be ignored

console.log(mySet.has(2)); // true
console.log(mySet.size);   // 2
mySet.delete(1);
mySet.clear();             // removes all elements
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is a `Map`?

A `Map` is a collection of **key-value pairs**, similar to an object, but with a few key differences:

* Keys can be **any type**, not just strings or symbols
* Maintains insertion order
* More flexible and predictable for dynamic key-value storage

### âœ¨ Common Methods:

```js
const myMap = new Map();

myMap.set('name', 'Alice');
myMap.set(42, 'The answer');
myMap.set(true, 'Yes');

console.log(myMap.get(42));       // "The answer"
console.log(myMap.has('name'));   // true
myMap.delete(true);
myMap.clear();                    // removes everything
```

## ðŸ’¡ LeetCode Example: "Intersection of Two Arrays" (Easy)

> Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be **unique**, and you may return the result in **any order**.

### ðŸ”— Problem: [LeetCode 349 - Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/)

### ðŸ§  Intuition:

We need to find unique common elements. This screams: **use `Set`**!

### âœ… JavaScript Solution:

```js
var intersection = function(nums1, nums2) {
  const set1 = new Set(nums1);
  const result = new Set();

  for (let num of nums2) {
    if (set1.has(num)) {
      result.add(num);
    }
  }

  return [...result]; // convert Set back to Array
};
```

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```js
intersection([1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2]); // Output: [2]
intersection([4, 9, 5], [9, 4, 9, 8, 4]); // Output: [4, 9]
```

## ðŸ†š When to Use `Set` vs `Map`

| Use Case                  | Use `Set`         | Use `Map`             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Unique values only        | âœ… Yes             | ðŸš« Not suitable       |
| Key-value pairs           | ðŸš« Not applicable | âœ… Yes                 |
| Fast membership check     | âœ… O(1) lookup     | âœ… O(1) key lookup     |
| Store extra info per item | ðŸš« No             | âœ… Yes (value per key) |

---

## ðŸ§µ Conclusion

Both `Set` and `Map` offer powerful capabilities that are often more efficient and expressive than arrays or plain objects, especially for algorithmic problems.

âœ… Use `Set` when you need uniqueness or fast existence checks.
âœ… Use `Map` when you need to associate values with keys (like a hash table).

ðŸ’¬ *Now it's your turn!* Try using `Set` and `Map` in your next LeetCode challenge â€” you'll be surprised how much cleaner your code becomes.
