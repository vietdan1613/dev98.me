## Scope

### What is Scope?

**Scope** defines **where a variable can be accessed** in your code.

JavaScript has:

* **Global scope** – variables available everywhere
* **Function scope** – variables inside a function
* **Block scope** – variables inside `{}` when using `let` or `const`

```js
function example() {
  let x = 10; // function scope
}
```

### Lexical Scope

JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, meaning scope is determined by **where code is written**, not where it’s executed.

```js
function outer() {
  let value = 42;

  function inner() {
    console.log(value); // accessible
  }
}
```

---

## closure

A **closure** happens when a function **remembers variables from its outer scope**, even after that outer function has finished running.

```js
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    return ++count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

👉 The inner function still has access to `count` — that’s a closure.

### Why Closures Matter

Closures are powerful because they enable:

* **Data encapsulation** (private variables)
* **State preservation**
* **Callbacks & event handlers**
* **React hooks and components**

Example of data privacy:

```js
function createUser() {
  let password = "secret";
  return input => input === password;
}
```

### Scope vs Closure (Quick Recap)

| Concept       | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Scope         | Where variables are accessible |
| Lexical Scope | Scope based on code structure  |
| Closure       | Function + remembered scope    |
