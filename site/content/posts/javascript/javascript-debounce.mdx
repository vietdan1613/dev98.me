> **Prevent expensive functions from running too often and hurting performance.**

## What Is Debouncing?

**Debouncing** ensures a function runs **only after a specified delay has passed since the last event**.

```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
}
```

### When to Use Debouncing

* Search input (API call after user stops typing)
* Auto-save

```js
input.addEventListener("input", debounce(handleSearch, 300));
```

## What Is Throttling?

**Throttling** ensures a function runs **at most once every fixed interval**, no matter how often the event fires.

```js
function throttle(fn, interval) {
  let lastTime = 0;
  return (...args) => {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastTime >= interval) {
      lastTime = now;
      fn(...args);
    }
  };
}
```

### When to Use Throttling

* Scroll events
* Window resizing

```js
window.addEventListener("scroll", throttle(handleScroll, 200));
```

🧠 **Key idea:** *Run regularly, but not too often.*

## Best Practices

* ✅ Use **debounce** for user input and API calls
* ✅ Use **throttle** for continuous UI events
* ❌ Avoid unthrottled scroll/resize handlers
* ✅ Prefer built-in helpers (`lodash.debounce`, `lodash.throttle`) in production
