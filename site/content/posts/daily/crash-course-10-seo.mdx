Before you launch your Next.js application into the world, there’s one essential concept you need to master: **SEO and metadata**.

Metadata determines how your site:

* Appears on Google
* Displays when shared on social platforms
* Communicates important Open Graph + Twitter Card information
* Helps search engines crawl your pages

Next.js provides a powerful, modern, and intuitive system for handling metadata.
In this guide, we’ll break down:

* Config-based metadata (static & dynamic)
* File-based metadata (favicon, robots, sitemap, OG images)
* Priority rules
* How to make your app SEO-friendly and shareable

Let’s get started.

---

# **1. What is Metadata in Next.js?**

Metadata controls:

* Page titles
* Description tags
* Social sharing cards
* Open Graph images
* Icons and favicons
* Robots & sitemap behavior

This directly affects how your content is perceived by:

* Users
* Search engines
* Social media platforms
* Messaging apps

Next.js makes this extremely easy using **two approaches**:

1. **Config-based metadata** → defined in code
2. **File-based metadata** → defined via special files in `/app`

Both are powerful, but serve different use cases.

---

# **2. Config-Based Metadata (Static)**

This is the most common approach.

In any `layout.tsx` or `page.tsx`, you can export a simple `metadata` object:

```ts
export const metadata = {
  title: "My Awesome Page",
  description: "This is an example of SEO-friendly metadata in Next.js.",
  openGraph: {
    title: "My Awesome Page",
    description: "Learn how to optimize SEO in Next.js.",
    images: ["/og-image.png"],
  },
};
```

### Where should you place this?

* **Root layout** → sets global defaults
* **Route layout/page** → overrides global metadata automatically

### Why config-based metadata is great:

✔ Easy to control
✔ Versionable (inside code)
✔ Per-route metadata override
✔ Works perfectly for static pages

But what if you need metadata that changes based on dynamic content?

---

# **3. Dynamic Metadata — `generateMetadata()`**

Dynamic routes (like blogs, product pages, user profiles) often need metadata based on the content they load.

Next.js solves this with:

```ts
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id);

  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.summary,
    openGraph: {
      images: [post.thumbnail],
    },
  };
}
```

### Key points:

* Works inside any dynamic `page.tsx`
* Receives `params` (like `[id]`)
* Can fetch data (async)
* Returns metadata dynamically

This is ideal for:

* Blog posts
* Product pages
* User profiles
* Dashboard routes
* Docs or CMS-driven content

---

# **4. File-Based Metadata (Highest Priority)**

Next.js also supports metadata defined by simply placing special files in the `app/` directory.

Examples:

| File                   | Purpose               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| `favicon.ico`          | Browser tab icon      |
| `icon.png`             | General site icon     |
| `apple-touch-icon.png` | iOS home screen icon  |
| `opengraph-image.png`  | Social sharing image  |
| `twitter-image.png`    | Twitter card image    |
| `robots.txt`           | Crawling rules        |
| `sitemap.xml`          | Search engine sitemap |

### Folder example:

```
app/
 ├── favicon.ico
 ├── icon.png
 ├── apple-touch-icon.png
 ├── opengraph-image.png
 ├── twitter-image.png
 ├── robots.txt
 └── sitemap.xml
```

Next.js automatically generates appropriate `<meta>` tags from these files.

### 🚨 Important:

**File-based metadata overrides config-based metadata.**

If you have:

* `favicon.ico` in `app/`
  AND
* `metadata.icon` in code

The file wins.

---

# **5. Metadata Priority Rules**

Understanding priority helps avoid conflicts:

1. **File-based metadata** (highest priority)
2. **Route-level metadata** (`page.tsx`, nested `layout.tsx`)
3. **Root layout metadata** (`app/layout.tsx`)

So:

* If a route exports its own metadata → it overrides the root.
* If file-based assets exist → they override *everything*.

---

# **6. Making Your Site Shareable & SEO-Friendly**

By combining:

* static metadata
* dynamic metadata
* file-based metadata

You ensure your website:

* Looks great when shared
* Displays rich previews on social apps
* Is fully crawlable by search engines
* Has optimized indexing
* Has unique metadata for every important page

This results in:

✔ Better visibility
✔ Higher click-through rates
✔ Stronger SEO performance
✔ Professional branding on social platforms

# **7. Conclusion: You're Ready to Build**

You’ve now learned:

* How metadata works in Next.js
* How to optimize SEO
* How to generate rich social previews
* How to set dynamic metadata for blog posts/products
* How file-based metadata works and its priority
* How to structure metadata across layouts and routes

With all this in place, you're now fully prepared to build and deploy a **professional, fully optimized Next.js application**.
