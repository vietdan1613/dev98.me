## What is ESLint? 🤔

Think of **ESLint** as your JavaScript code coach 🧑‍🏫.
It watches your code and gently taps you on the shoulder with things like:

* “Hey, you forgot a semicolon!”
* “Careful, you never used that variable.”
* “That function name doesn’t follow the project’s style.”

Basically, ESLint helps you **catch mistakes early** and keep your code **clean and consistent**.
It’s not rewriting your code — it’s **guiding you** to write better code by pointing out errors, bad patterns, or inconsistencies *before* they cause real problems.

### The real power of ESLint: rules ✨

One of the best things about ESLint is that it’s **fully customizable**.

* Want semicolons everywhere? ✅
* Hate semicolons? Also fine 😎
* Prefer single quotes instead of double? Easy!

That’s where ESLint really shines. You (or your team) decide what “good code” means, and ESLint enforces it automatically. This is huge for team projects, because everyone follows the same standards — no more style chaos.

## What about Prettier? 💅

If ESLint is your coach, **Prettier is your code stylist**.

Prettier doesn’t care what your code *does* — it only cares about how it *looks*.

You know those endless debates about:

* Should `{` be on the same line or a new one?
* Tabs or spaces?
* How many spaces for indentation?

Prettier’s answer is simple:

> “Don’t waste brainpower on that — I’ve got you.”

It **automatically formats your code** the same way every single time:

* spacing
* quotes
* indentation
* line breaks

No more arguments in code reviews about formatting. Everyone gets the same clean, consistent style by default.

---

## ESLint + Prettier = The Dream Team 💪

* **ESLint** keeps your code **correct**
* **Prettier** keeps your code **pretty**

Together, they make your codebase feel **polished and professional**, so you can focus on building cool stuff instead of worrying about tiny syntax or formatting issues.

---

## The best part if you’re just starting 🚀

You don’t need to memorize all the rules or stress about setup.

If you’re using **Next.js**, ESLint already comes **pre-configured** out of the box. That means you start benefiting from clean, consistent code immediately.

But let’s make it even better by adding **Prettier** on top.

---

## Step 1: Install Prettier (and Tailwind plugin)

Run this in your project root:

```bash
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

This installs Prettier and a plugin that automatically sorts Tailwind CSS classes for you ✨.

---

## Step 2: Create a `.prettierrc` config file

In the root of your project, create a file named **`.prettierrc`**
(Don’t forget the dot `.` — it matters!)

Paste this config inside:

```json
{
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "semi": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 120,
  "endOfLine": "auto",
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"]
}
```

This file tells Prettier exactly how you want your code to look.

---

## Step 3: Tell Prettier what to ignore

Create a file called **`.prettierignore`** in the root of your app and add:

```txt
node_modules
.next
out
build
.next
*.log
.env*
public
```

These files aren’t part of your source code, so we don’t care if they’re pretty or not 😅.

---

## Step 4: VS Code / Cursor setup (recommended)

If you’re using **VS Code** or **Cursor**, create this file:

**`.vscode/settings.json`**

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit",
    "source.addMissingImports": "explicit"
  },
  "prettier.tabWidth": 2,
  "prettier.useTabs": false,
  "prettier.semi": true,
  "prettier.singleQuote": false,
  "prettier.jsxSingleQuote": false,
  "prettier.trailingComma": "es5",
  "prettier.arrowParens": "always",
  "[json]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[typescript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[typescriptreact]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[javascriptreact]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib"
}
```

This setup ensures:

* Code formats automatically on save ✨
* ESLint fixes issues where possible
* Imports are cleaned up automatically
