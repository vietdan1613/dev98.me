By now, we’ve built slices, dispatched actions, and even fetched data from APIs using `createAsyncThunk`. But as your app grows, debugging becomes more and more important.

This is where **Redux DevTools** comes in — a powerful debugging tool that lets you **see inside your Redux store in real time**.

In this lesson, we’ll learn how to:

* Use **Time-Travel Debugging**
* **Inspect actions** and state changes step-by-step
* Debug issues like **API errors** and **infinite re-renders**

---

## 🔎 What is Redux DevTools?

Redux DevTools is a browser extension that helps you:

* See **every action** that gets dispatched
* Inspect **how the state changes** after each action
* Jump backward and forward through state history (**time-travel**)

### Install It:

Chrome: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools)
Firefox: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/)

Once installed, open your browser dev tools → you’ll see a **Redux** tab.

## 🕰 Time-Travel Debugging

Time-travel debugging allows you to **go back to previous states** to understand how they changed.

For example:

1. Click **+** three times on the counter app
2. You’ll see actions:

   * increment
   * increment
   * increment
3. Click on each action in the DevTools panel
4. The UI will update to show what the app looked like at that moment

This is extremely helpful for:

* Testing user flows
* Tracking UI bugs
* Understanding **unexpected state changes**

## 🔍 Inspecting Actions & State Changes

Every time you dispatch an action, Redux DevTools logs:

| Item       | What it tells you                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Action** | What happened (e.g., `fetchPokemon/pending`)   |
| **State**  | The full Redux state before & after the action |
| **Diff**   | What changed in the state                      |

For example, when fetching Pokémon:

```
fetchPokemon/pending
fetchPokemon/fulfilled
```

You can inspect how `status`, `items`, and `error` changed at each step.

### This makes debugging super clear.

## 🐞 Debugging Common Issues

### 1. API Not Working → Check Action Sequence

If the fetch fails, DevTools will show:

```
fetchPokemon/rejected
```

Click it → check `error` state → now you know what went wrong
(e.g., wrong URL, CORS issue, API offline)

---

### 2. Infinite Re-Render Loop

If your component keeps re-rendering repeatedly:

* Check if you're calling `dispatch()` **inside render** instead of `useEffect`.

❌ BAD:

```jsx
dispatch(fetchPokemon());
```

✅ GOOD:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  dispatch(fetchPokemon());
}, [dispatch]);
```

DevTools can show you **hundreds of repeated actions** → this is a red flag.

---

### 3. State Not Updating

If the UI doesn't reflect assigned updates:

* Check your reducer logic in the slice
* Ensure you're modifying the correct value
* Look at the **Diff** panel to confirm the state changed

## 🎯 Summary

Redux DevTools helps you:

| Feature                  | Benefit                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Time-Travel Debugging    | Understand how the state evolved step-by-step |
| Action Inspection        | See exactly what triggered state changes      |
| State Diff               | Quickly spot what changed and why             |
| Debug Loops / API Issues | Fix problems faster                           |

Learning how to debug is just as important as learning how to code. Debug faster → Learn faster → Build better.
