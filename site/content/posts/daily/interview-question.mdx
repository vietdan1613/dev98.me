#  React Technical

### 1. Can you explain the React component lifecycle?

> Mounting      
> Updating      
> Unmounting        

> What causes a component to re-render?     
> - State changes, prop changes, or parent re-renders

> What is controlled vs uncontrolled components
> - Controlled components have their state managed by React (via props/state)
> - Uncontrolled components manage their own state (via refs/DOM)

> What is a Pure Component?
> - A component that renders the same output for the same props/state.

> What is a Higher Order Component (HOC)?
> - A function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced behavior.

> What is reconciliation in React?     
> - React’s process of diffing the virtual DOM and updating the real DOM efficiently.

> What is the difference between `useEffect()` and `useLayoutEffect()`?       
> - `useEffect` → runs after paint (non-blocking)     
> - `useLayoutEffect` → runs before paint (blocking)

> Why is useLayoutEffect considered dangerous if misused?     
> - It can block rendering and cause performance issues if it contains heavy computations.

> Give a real-world use case for useLayoutEffect     
> - Measuring DOM elements before paint (e.g., calculating sizes for animations)

> How does Concurrent Rendering affect lifecycle behavior?     
> - It allows React to interrupt rendering, which can change when effects run and improve responsiveness.

### What is your error-handling strategy in production apps?

> - Use Error Boundaries to catch rendering errors.   
> - try/catch in async code.      

> What are Error Boundaries?      
> - React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree.      

> What errors do Error Boundaries NOT catch?      
> - Event handlers, async code, server-side rendering.        

> How do you handle errors in event handlers?     
> - Use try/catch blocks within the event handler functions.      

> How do you handle errors with React Query?      
> - Use onError callbacks and error states provided by React Query hooks.     

> Different between isError, error?   
> - isError is a boolean flag;    
> - error contains the actual error object/details.   

### 3. How do you render a list in React?

> - Use `Array.map()` to create elements from data arrays.        
> - Use unique `key` props for each item.

> Why are keys important in React lists?        
> - Keys help React identify which items have changed, added, or removed for efficient updates.

> What makes a good key?        
> - Unique, stable identifiers (e.g., IDs). Avoid using indexes if the list can change

> Can you use array index as a key?        
> - Only if the list is static and won’t change order or have items added/removed.

> What happens if you don’t provide keys?        
> - React will use indexes by default, which can lead to inefficient updates and bugs.

> How do you optimize large lists?        
> - Use virtualization libraries (e.g., react-window) to render only visible items.

> How useId() differs from key?
> -`useId` generates a new value per render
> - Keys must be stable across renders

### 4. What is the Context API?

> - A way to share state globally without prop drilling.        
> - Use `React.createContext()`, `Provider`, and `useContext()`.

> When should you use Context?        
> - For global state like themes, auth, or settings.

> How Context Works        
> - Create a context with `React.createContext()`. Wrap components with `Provider` to supply values. Use `useContext()` to consume values.

> Performance Considerations        
> - Context updates re-render all consumers. Optimize by splitting contexts or memoizing values.        

### 5. What causes performance issues in React apps?

> - Unnecessary re-renders, large component trees, heavy computations in render.

> How do you optimize it?
> - Memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`)    
> - Split components & state    
> - Virtualize large lists    
> - Optimize Context usage    

> How do you detect and diagnose **unnecessary re-renders**?        
> - React DevTools Profiler        
> - Console logging renders        

> The different between `React.memo()`, `useMemo()`, and `useCallback()`?        
> - `React.memo` → memoizes entire components        
> - `useMemo` → memoizes computed values        
> - `useCallback` → memoizes functions        

> When should you use `React.memo()` and when should you avoid it?        
> - Use it when re-renders are expensive and props are stable        
> - Avoid when renders are cheap or props change frequently        

> How would you optimize **rendering a list with thousands of items**?        
> - List virtualization (`react-window`)        
> - Memoized row components        

> When would you use `useDeferredValue()` or `useTransition()`?       
> - For deferring non-urgent updates to keep the UI responsive during heavy rendering.        
> - `useDeferredValue` delay rendering non-urgent derived values. Example: filtering a large list while typing.   
> - `useTransition` mark updates as low-priority. Example: switching tabs while fetching/rendering data.    

### 6. What is React Testing Library (RTL)?

> - A testing library focused on testing React components via the DOM, simulating real user interactions.

> How do you find elements in RTL?
> - Use accessible queries like `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByText`.

> Why is getByRole preferred?
> - It reflects how users interact with the app and improves test reliability.

> What’s the difference between getBy, queryBy, and findBy?
> - `getBy` throws an error if not found (synchronous)    
> - `queryBy` returns null if not found (synchronous)    
> - `findBy` returns a promise and waits for the element (asynchronous)

> Why prefer userEvent over fireEvent?
> - `userEvent` simulates real user interactions more accurately (e.g., typing, clicking).

> Why do we avoid testing implementation details?
> - Tests should focus on user-visible behavior, not internal component structure.

> When should you mock and when not?
> - Mock external dependencies (APIs, timers) but avoid mocking DOM/browser APIs unless necessary.

> Why use MSW instead of mocking fetch?
> - MSW mocks at the network level, providing realistic responses and reusable mocks across tests.

> What’s the biggest mistake people make with RTL?
> - Testing implementation details instead of user behavior.
> - Manual ReactDOM testing

> What is JSDOM?
> - JSDOM is a JavaScript implementation of the DOM and HTML standards, used for testing React components in a Node.js environment without a real browser.

> Which browser APIs are missing or incomplete in **JSDOM**?
> - `ResizeObserver`, `matchMedia`, `Clipboard`

> Why is mocking browser APIs called **“poking a hole in reality”**?
> - Mocks reduce realism; **integration/e2e tests should minimize mocking** to better reflect real user environments.

> When testing forms, what user behaviors should be simulated?
> - Typing, clicking, focusing, submitting, and validation feedback, not direct state manipulation.

> Which matcher do you use?
> - `toBeInTheDocument()` to check presence in the DOM.
> - `toHaveTextContent()` to verify text content.
> - `toHaveAttribute()` to check element attributes.
> - `toBeVisible()` to ensure element visibility.

### 7. What patterns do you apply in your React project?

> - Composition -> avoid prop drilling
> - Latest ref -> store the latest value
> - Compound components -> shared state
> - Prop collection -> full control

> Why use Component Composition instead of inheritance?
> - It lets components receive behavior and UI via children instead of passing props deeply, improving flexibility and reuse.
> - Example use cases: tabs, layouts, dropdowns.

> Why store the latest value in useRef instead of state for async logic?
> - Refs update without triggering re-renders, making them ideal for async callbacks that need the latest value.
> - Example use cases: timers, debounce, async callbacks.

> What are Compound Components in React?
> - A pattern where related components share state via Context, allowing flexible APIs without prop drilling.
> - Example use cases: tabs, accordions, dropdowns.

> How does the **state reducer pattern** customize behavior?
> - **It lets consumers intercept and modify state transitions without changing internal component logic.**

> Advantage of a Prop Getter over prop collection?
> - Prop getters give consumers full control while still applying required logic, preventing accidental overrides.
> - Example use cases: custom inputs, dropdowns, modals.

#  State Management

### 1. **How do you decide whether a piece of state belongs in Redux, React Query, or local component state?**

> * UI state -> Local state
> * Global state -> Redux 
> * Server data ->	React Query
> * Auth -> Context + storage

### 2. What is Redux Toolkit?

> * UI → Action → Middleware → Reducer → Store → UI
> * Redux Toolkit is recommended way to write Redux that reduces boilerplate and enforces best practices.

> What does createSlice do?   
> - Combines state, reducers, and actions in one place

> How can RTK allow “mutating” state?     
> - Uses Immer to convert mutations to immutable updates

> What is configureStore?     
> - Sets up the Redux store with good defaults (DevTools, middleware)

> How you use middleware in RTK?      
> - Use with libraries redux-logger

> What is createAsyncThunk?       
> - Simplifies async logic (CRUD, single API calls)

> Can one slice respond to actions from another slice?        
> - Yes, using extraReducers

> extraReducers vs reducers?      
> - reducers handle this slice’s actions; extraReducers handle external actions

### 3. What is Redux Saga?

> * Middleware for handling complex async side effects in Redux applications.

> Why does Redux-Saga use generator functions?        
> - Generators allow pausing and resuming async logic.

> What is a saga?     
> - A saga is a generator function that handles side effects.

> Difference between call and put and fork?       
> - call runs a function, put dispatches an action.
> - call is blocking—the saga waits for the function to complete. 
> - fork is non-blocking and runs the task in the background, allowing concurrent execution.

> What does takeLatest do?        
> - Runs only the latest action, cancels previous ones.

> Difference between takeEvery, takeLatest, and takeLeading?      
> - takeEvery runs for every action.      
> - takeLatest runs only the latest action, cancelling previous ones.     
> - takeLeading runs only the first action, ignoring subsequent ones until it completes.      

> How do you run multiple API calls in parallel?      
> - Use yield all([...]) to run effects concurrently.     

> How do you handle errors in Redux-Saga?     
> - Use try/catch blocks inside sagas.        

> How do you cancel a running saga?       
> - Using takeLatest or cancel.       

> What is race and when would you use it?     
> - race runs multiple effects and completes when the first one finishes.     

> Why should reducers remain pure when using Redux-Saga?      
> - To ensure predictable state updates and maintainability.

### 4. **What is React Query?**

> Data-fetching library for React that simplifies server state management.    
> - React Query manages server state—fetching, caching, and syncing data with the server.

> What is a mutation?     
> - A mutation is an operation that modifies server data (POST, PUT, DELETE).

> What are query keys and why are they important?     
> - Query keys uniquely identify queries for caching and refetching.

> How does React Query handle caching?        
> - Caches data based on query keys and provides stale-while-revalidate behavior.

> What is staleTime?      
> - Duration data is considered fresh before being marked stale.

> What is cacheTime / gcTime?     
> - Duration unused data remains in cache before garbage collection.

> When does React Query refetch automatically?        
> - On window focus, network reconnect, or interval-based refetching.

> What does enabled do?       
> - Controls whether a query should automatically run.

> Difference between isLoading and isFetching?        
> - isLoading is true on the initial fetch; isFetching is true on any fetch (initial or subsequent).

> How do you invalidate queries?      
> - Use queryClient.invalidateQueries(queryKey) to refetch data.

> How do you perform optimistic updates?      
> - Update the UI immediately, then roll back if the mutation fails.

> How do you handle pagination and infinite scrolling?        
> - Use useInfiniteQuery for fetching paginated data.

> How do you handle mutation errors?      
> - Use onError callback in useMutation to handle errors.

### 11. What is a **`shallow copy` vs `deep copy`**?

> How can you create them in JavaScript?

### 12. What is **`immutability`**?

> Why is it important in modern frameworks like React?

### 14. What happens when you use `new` with a function?

> Explain constructor behavior step by step.

### 15. What is **`memory leak`** in JavaScript?

> What are common causes and how can you prevent them?

### 16. What is scope and lexical scope?

> - Scope is the current context of code, determining variable accessibility. 
> - Lexical scope means scope is determined by the code structure.

### 17. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

> - Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
> - Non-primitive types: object, array, function

### 18. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

> - `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared.
> - `let` is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared.
> - `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.

### 19. What is event delegation?

> Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element to handle events for its child elements, improving performance and simplifying code.

> How we stop event propagation?
> - Use `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent the event from bubbling up the DOM tree.

### 20. What is the difference between `call`, `apply`, and `bind`?

- `call` invokes a function with a specified `this` context and arguments passed individually.
- `apply` invokes a function with a specified `this` context and arguments passed as an array.
- `bind` returns a new function with a specified `this` context and optional preset arguments.

### Difference between setTimeout and setInterval?

- `setTimeout` executes a function once after a specified delay.
- `setInterval` repeatedly executes a function at specified intervals.

#  TypeScript

### 1. What are the **main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript**?

> * TypeScript catches type errors at compile time.
> * type, interfaces, enums.
> * deriving and narrowing types.
> * keyof and typeof operators.
> * generics types.
> * Record, Partial, Pick, Omit utility types.
> * satisfies operator for type checking without changing inferred type.
> * any vs unknown vs never

> difference between type and interface and enum.
> - interfaces can be extended or merged, while type aliases cannot.
> - type can represent more complex types like unions and intersections.
> - enums define a set of named constants.

> how unions and intersections work.
> - unions allow a variable to hold multiple types (A | B), while intersections combine types (A & B).

> how deriving and narrowing types work.
> - TypeScript can infer types based on usage, and you can narrow types using type guards.

> what are keyof and typeof operators, how you use them?
> - keyof gets the keys of a type as a union of string literals.
> - typeof gets the type of a variable or expression.
> - use them for dynamic type manipulation.

> what are Record, Partial, Pick, and Omit. how do you use them?
> - Record creates an object type with specified keys and value types.
> - Partial makes all properties of a type optional.
> - Pick selects specific properties from a type.
> - Omit removes specific properties from a type.

> what is genneric types in TypeScript? how do you use them?
> - Generics allow you to create reusable components and functions that work with any data type while maintaining type safety.

> what is the satisfies operator? when would you use it?
> - The satisfies operator checks that an expression matches a specific type without changing its inferred type. 
> - It’s useful for validating complex objects while preserving their specific types.

> what is any vs unknown vs never?
> - any disables type checking, allowing any value.    
> - unknown is a safer alternative to any, requiring type checks before usage.    
> - never represents values that never occur, useful for functions that always throw or never return.

> what are optional properties and readonly?
> - Optional properties may or may not be present in an object (using ?).
> - Readonly properties cannot be modified after initialization.

> how TypeScript work with third-party JS libraries?
> - Use type declaration files (.d.ts) to provide type information for libraries without built-in TypeScript support.

# CSS/SCSS/Tailwind

### 1. What are CSS pre-processors?

> how do features like variables, nesting, and mixins (e.g., in Sass or Less) improve maintainability and scalability in large applications?

### 2. What is Tailwind CSS, and how is it different from traditional CSS or SCSS?

> Why is it called a utility-first framework?

### 3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Tailwind CSS?

> When would you choose Tailwind over SCSS or CSS Modules?

### 4. How does Tailwind CSS handle responsive design?

> Explain breakpoints and mobile-first styling.

### 8. How do you optimize Tailwind CSS for production?

> Explain tree-shaking and purging unused styles.

### 9. How do you ensure accessibility (a11y)?

> Focus on color contrast, focus states, and semantic HTML.

# Accessibility

### 1. How you improve web accessibility in your projects?

> - Use semantic HTML elements
> - Ensure keyboard navigability
> - Provide alt text for images
> - Use ARIA roles and attributes appropriately
> - Ensure sufficient color contrast
> - Test with screen readers

# Tool

### 1. What are software development tools, and why are they important in modern web development?

> - They help automate tasks, improve code quality, and streamline workflows.
> - Examples: 
>   - VScode for code editing
>   - Git for version control
>   - Vite or Webpack for build tools
>   - Jest and React Testing Library for testing frameworks
>   - Jira for project management

> What is Vite, and why would you choose it over Webpack?
> - Webpack is a powerful but complex module bundler that can have slower build times and requires more configuration.
> - Vite is a modern build tool that offers faster development startup and hot module replacement (HMR) using native ES modules.

# Development process

### 1. Can you walk me through your typical software development process from requirements and planning to release and maintenance?

> 1. Requirements Gathering: Understand project goals.
> 2. Planning: Break down requirements into tasks, estimate effort.
> 3. Design: create a wireframe, folder architecture, data flow.
> 4. Development: Write code following best practices
> 5. Testing: Perform unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to catch bugs and ensure functionality.
> 6. Deployment: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
> 7. Maintenance: Monitor performance, fix bugs

# CI/CD

1. Can you describe your **CI/CD experience**?

> * What CI/CD tools have you used (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Bitbucket)?   
> * What stages were included (lint, test, build, deploy)?

# HTML

### 1. What are semantic HTML elements, and why are they important?

> Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. They improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.
> - Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
> - section: groups related content
> - article: self-contained content

> How do semantic elements improve accessibility?
> - Screen readers and assistive technologies can better understand the structure and purpose of content.

> What is the difference between div and span?
> - `<div>` is a block-level element used for grouping larger sections of content.
> - `<span>` is an inline element used for styling or grouping small pieces of text within

> What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block?
> - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`).
> - Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`).
> - Inline-block elements are similar to inline but allow setting width and height (e.g., `<img>`, `<button>`).

> What are data attributes?
> Data attributes allow you to store extra information on HTML elements using attributes prefixed with `data-` (e.g., `data-user-id="123"`). They are useful for storing custom data without affecting the element's presentation or behavior.

# CSS

1. How you using css in your React project?

> - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

> Difference between Flexbox and Grid?
> - Flexbox is one-dimensional (row or column) for aligning items along a single axis.
> - Grid is two-dimensional for controlling both rows and columns.

> Position values in CSS?
> - static: default position
> - relative: positioned relative to its normal position
> - absolute: positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
> - fixed: positioned relative to the viewport
> - sticky: toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll position

> What is the box model in CSS?
> - Content: the actual content of the element
> - Padding: space between content and border
> - Border: the border surrounding the padding (if any)
> - Margin: space outside the border

> What is the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden?
> - display: none removes the element from the document flow, and it does not take up space.
> - visibility: hidden hides the element but it still takes up space in the layout.

### 2. What are CSS pre-processors?

> - CSS pre-processors like Sass and Less extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions.

> when would you use a pre-processor?
> - For large projects needing modular, maintainable, and reusable styles.

> How do variables work in Sass?
> - Variables store values (colors, fonts) for reuse throughout stylesheets.

> How does nesting work in Sass?
> - Nesting allows writing CSS rules inside other rules, reflecting the HTML structure.

> How do mixins work in Sass?
> - Mixins are reusable blocks of styles that can be included in other selectors.

> How do functions work in Sass?
> - Functions perform calculations and return values for use in styles.

### 3. what is Tailwind CSS?

> - Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes for building custom designs without writing custom CSS.

- When would you choose Tailwind over SCSS or CSS Modules?
> - For rapid development, consistent design, and reduced CSS bloat.

> What is meant by utility-first framework?
> - It emphasizes using small, single-purpose classes to build components directly in the markup.

> How does Tailwind CSS handle responsive design?
> - Tailwind uses mobile-first breakpoints with utility classes prefixed by screen sizes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`).

> How does dark mode work in Tailwind CSS?
> - Dark mode can be implemented using media queries or a class strategy (e.g., adding a `dark` class to the root element).

> What is @apply, and when should (or shouldn’t) you use it?
> - `@apply` allows you to compose utility classes into custom CSS classes. Use it sparingly to avoid losing the benefits of utility-first styling.

> What problems can misuse of @apply cause?
> - It can lead to larger CSS files and reduced maintainability if overused.

> How do you manage reusable components and consistency in Tailwind?
> - Use utility composition for small components, component abstraction for larger ones, and design tokens for consistent theming.

> How do you optimize Tailwind CSS for production?
> - Use PurgeCSS to remove unused styles and enable tree-shaking in the build process.

# Agile

### 1. what is Agile methodology?

> - Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases.


> How Agile methodologies improve software development processes in your team? 
> - They promote adaptability to change, enhance communication, and deliver value incrementally.
> - They encourage continuous improvement through regular retrospectives and feedback loops.
> - They foster a collaborative environment where cross-functional teams work together effectively.

> What are some common Agile frameworks or practices you have experience with?
> - Scrum: roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner), ceremonies (sprints, stand-ups, retrospectives)
> - User stories: capturing requirements from the user perspective

# Architecture

### 1. How do you structure a large React application for scalability and maintainability?

> - Use a modular folder structure (components, pages, services, hooks, utils)
> - Follow component-driven development
> - Use state management (Redux, Context API) appropriately
> - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
> - Write comprehensive tests (unit, integration, e2e)
> - API layer for data fetching and caching
