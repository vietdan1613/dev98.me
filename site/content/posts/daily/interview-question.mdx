> how does it differ from writing UI using plain JavaScript (React.createElement)?

### 2. Can you explain the React component lifecycle?

> What are the main phases and lifecycle methods/hooks?

### 4. **What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?**

> How do they enhance component functionality?

### 5. **What is the difference between `useEffect()` and `useLayoutEffect()`?**

> * `useEffect` → runs after paint (non-blocking)
> * `useLayoutEffect` → runs before paint (blocking)

### 6. How does React handle **event handling**?

> * Synthetic Events
> * Event delegation

### 7. What are **controlled vs uncontrolled components** in React?

> * Controlled → React state manages form data
> * Uncontrolled → DOM manages form data

### 8. How does **React’s reconciliation algorithm** work?

> * Virtual DOM diffing
> * Key props for list items

### 9. What are **fragments** in React, and when would you use them?

> * Group multiple elements without extra DOM nodes

### 10. How do you handle **error boundaries** in React?

> * Class components with `componentDidCatch`
> * Catch rendering errors

### 11. What is the purpose of **keys** in React lists?

> * Identify items for efficient updates
> * Stable identity across renders

### 12. How does **React’s Context API** work?

> * Share state globally without prop drilling
> * `Provider` and `Consumer` components or `useContext` hook

# Tech - React Performance

### 1. How do you optimize **React performance**?

> **Reduce unnecessary re-renders and expensive computations**
>
> * Memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`)
> * Split components & state
> * Avoid inline objects/functions
> * Virtualize large lists
> * Optimize Context usage

### 2. How would you optimize **rendering a list with thousands of items**?

> **Render only what the user sees**
>
> * List virtualization (`react-window`, `react-virtualized`)
> * Stable `key` props
> * Memoized row components
> * Avoid heavy logic inside render

### 3. When would you use `useDeferredValue()` or `useTransition()`?

> **To keep the UI responsive during expensive updates**
>
> * **`useDeferredValue`** → delay rendering non-urgent derived values    
>  *Example:* filtering a large list while typing
> * **`useTransition`** → mark updates as low-priority    
>   *Example:* switching tabs while fetching/rendering data

### 4. Why can using **Context** cause performance issues?

> **All consumers re-render when context value changes**
>
> How to optimize:
>
> * Split context into smaller ones
> * Memoize context value
> * Use context selectors
> * Avoid frequently changing values in Context

### 5. How do you detect and diagnose **unnecessary re-renders**?

> **Measure first, then optimize**
>
> * React DevTools Profiler
> * `why-did-you-render`
> * Console logging renders
> * Check props reference equality

### 6. When should you use `React.memo()` and when should you avoid it?

> **Use it when re-renders are expensive and props are stable**
>
> Use when:
>
> * Pure components
> * Large lists
> * Frequent parent re-renders
>
> Avoid when:
>
> * Cheap renders
> * Props change every render
> * Over-optimization hurts readability

# Tech - React Testing

### 1. What are the drawbacks of **manual ReactDOM testing**, and how does RTL address them?

> Manual testing couples tests to implementation details; **RTL tests behavior via the DOM**, making tests more reliable and maintainable.

### 2. Why should React tests resemble **real user interactions**?

> Because **users don’t care about component internals**, testing behavior ensures refactor-safe, meaningful tests.

### 3. What is the problem of the **“Test User”**, and how does RTL reduce it?

> The “Test User” interacts unrealistically; **RTL enforces realistic queries and interactions**, reducing false confidence.

### 4. What RTL queries best reflect how users find elements?

> **Accessible queries**:
>
> * `getByRole`
> * `getByLabelText`
> * `getByText`
> * `getByPlaceholderText`
>
> (avoid `getByTestId` unless necessary)

### 5. When testing forms, what user behaviors should be simulated?

> **Typing, clicking, focusing, submitting, and validation feedback**, not direct state manipulation.

### 6. Why mock HTTP requests, and how does **MSW** improve mocking?

> To avoid real network calls; **MSW mocks at the network layer**, making tests realistic and reusable across unit/integration tests.

### 7. Which browser APIs are missing or incomplete in **JSDOM**?

> APIs like:
>
> * `IntersectionObserver`
> * `ResizeObserver`
> * `matchMedia`
> * `Clipboard`
> * `Canvas`
>  often need manual mocks.

### 8. Why is mocking browser APIs called **“poking a hole in reality”**?

> Mocks reduce realism; **integration/e2e tests should minimize mocking** to better reflect real user environments.

### 9. Why test custom hooks via a **test component**?

> Hooks depend on React’s lifecycle; **wrapping them ensures correct execution context** and realistic behavior.

### 10. What problem does a **custom render function** solve when testing Context?

> It **automatically wraps components with required providers**, reducing duplication and setup complexity.

# Tech - React Pattern

### 1. How does the **composition pattern** help reduce prop drilling?

> **It lets components receive behavior and UI via children instead of passing props deeply**, improving flexibility and reuse.

### 2. Why store the **latest value in `useRef` instead of state** for async logic?

> **Refs update without triggering re-renders**, making them ideal for async callbacks that need the latest value.

### 3️⃣ What does **React Context enable in the compound components pattern**?

> **It allows shared state and behavior between related components without prop drilling**, enabling clean and flexible APIs.

### 4️⃣ What problem does the **slot pattern** solve?

> **It allows parents to inject content into specific child “slots” even when the structure is deeply nested or indirect.**

### 5️⃣ What is the advantage of a **prop getter** over prop collection?

> **Prop getters give consumers full control while still applying required logic**, preventing accidental overrides.

### 6️⃣ Why does the **state initializer pattern** store initial value in `useRef`?

> **To compute expensive initial state only once**, avoiding unnecessary recalculation on every render.

### 7️⃣ How does the **state reducer pattern** customize behavior?

> **It lets consumers intercept and modify state transitions without changing internal component logic.**

### 8️⃣ How does a component decide if it is **controlled or uncontrolled**?

> **If a value prop is provided → controlled; otherwise → uncontrolled with internal state.**

### 9️⃣ Which pattern lets you **block or modify specific state changes**?

> **The state reducer pattern**, because it centralizes and controls how state updates are applied.

# Tech - State Management

### 1. **How do you decide whether a piece of state belongs in Redux, React Query, or local component state?**

> * UI state -> Local state
> * Global state -> Redux 
> * Server data ->	React Query
> * Auth -> Context + storage

### 2. What is Redux Toolkit?

> * UI → Action → Middleware → Reducer → Store → UI
> * Redux Toolkit is recommended way to write Redux that reduces boilerplate and enforces best practices.

> - What does createSlice do?   
>   Combines state, reducers, and actions in one place

> * How can RTK allow “mutating” state?     
>  Uses Immer to convert mutations to immutable updates

> * What is configureStore?     
> Sets up the Redux store with good defaults (DevTools, middleware)

> * How you use middleware in RTK?      
>  Use with libraries redux-logger

> * What is createAsyncThunk?       
>  Simplifies async logic (CRUD, single API calls)

> * Can one slice respond to actions from another slice?        
>  Yes, using extraReducers

> * extraReducers vs reducers?      
> reducers handle this slice’s actions; extraReducers handle external actions

### 3. What is Redux Saga?

> * Middleware for handling complex async side effects in Redux applications.

> * Why does Redux-Saga use generator functions?        
> Generators allow pausing and resuming async logic.

> * What is a saga?     
> A saga is a generator function that handles side effects.

> * Difference between call and put and fork?       
> call runs a function, put dispatches an action.
> call is blocking—the saga waits for the function to complete. 
> fork is non-blocking and runs the task in the background, allowing concurrent execution.

> * What does takeLatest do?        
> Runs only the latest action, cancels previous ones.

> * Difference between takeEvery, takeLatest, and takeLeading?      
> takeEvery runs for every action.      
> takeLatest runs only the latest action, cancelling previous ones.     
> takeLeading runs only the first action, ignoring subsequent ones until it completes.      

> * How do you run multiple API calls in parallel?      
> Use yield all([...]) to run effects concurrently.     

> * How do you handle errors in Redux-Saga?     
> Use try/catch blocks inside sagas.        

> * How do you cancel a running saga?       
> Using takeLatest or cancel.       

> * What is race and when would you use it?     
> race runs multiple effects and completes when the first one finishes.     

> * Why should reducers remain pure when using Redux-Saga?      
> To ensure predictable state updates and maintainability.

### 4. **What is React Query?**

> * Data-fetching library for React that simplifies server state management.    
> React Query manages server state—fetching, caching, and syncing data with the server.

> * What is a mutation?     
> A mutation is an operation that modifies server data (POST, PUT, DELETE).

> * What are query keys and why are they important?     
> Query keys uniquely identify queries for caching and refetching.

> * How does React Query handle caching?        
> Caches data based on query keys and provides stale-while-revalidate behavior.

> * What is staleTime?      
> Duration data is considered fresh before being marked stale.

> * What is cacheTime / gcTime?     
> Duration unused data remains in cache before garbage collection.

> * When does React Query refetch automatically?        
> On window focus, network reconnect, or interval-based refetching.

> * What does enabled do?       
> Controls whether a query should automatically run.

> * Difference between isLoading and isFetching?        
> isLoading is true on the initial fetch; isFetching is true on any fetch (initial or subsequent).

> * How do you invalidate queries?      
> Use queryClient.invalidateQueries(queryKey) to refetch data.

> * How do you perform optimistic updates?      
> Update the UI immediately, then roll back if the mutation fails.

> * How do you handle pagination and infinite scrolling?        
> Use useInfiniteQuery for fetching paginated data.

> * How do you handle mutation errors?      
> Use onError callback in useMutation to handle errors.
