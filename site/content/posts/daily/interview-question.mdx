2. **What do you know about our company?**
3. **What interests you about this position?**
4. **When you get stuck and can’t solve a problem, how do you proceed?**
5. **How do you learn and improve your skills?**
6. **How do you handle working on a challenging feature?**
7. **What tools do you use to manage your work?**
8. **When starting a project, how do you plan and organize your work to ensure completion?**
9. **Can you describe a recent project you’ve been working on?**
10. **How do you handle stress and pressure at work?**
11. **What are your strengths?**
12. **What are your weaknesses?**
13. **What is your preferred working or management style?**
14. **Have you ever mentored a junior team member? What is your leadership style?**
15. **Where do you see yourself in five years?**
16. **What are your salary expectations?**

## React Performance Questions

1. **How do you optimize React performance?**
2. **How would you optimize rendering a list with thousands of items?**
3. **When would you use `useDeferredValue()` or `useTransition()`? Can you give an example?**
4. **Why can using `Context` lead to performance bottlenecks, and how can you optimize it?**
5. **How do you detect and diagnose unnecessary re-renders in a React application?**
6. **When should you use `React.memo()` and when should you avoid it?**

## Store

1. **What is the difference between `React Query` and `Redux`?**
2. **When would you use `Redux Thunk` and when would you use `Redux Saga`?**
3. **How does `React Query` improve application performance?**

## Base

1. **What is the difference between `useEffect()` and `useLayoutEffect()`?**
2. **What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?**
3. **Can you explain the React component lifecycle?**

## Testing

1. **What are the drawbacks of manual ReactDOM testing, and how does React Testing Library (RTL) address them?**
2. **Why is it important for React tests to resemble real user interactions instead of testing implementation details?**
3. **What is the problem of avoiding the “Test User,” and how does RTL help reduce this issue?**
4. **RTL promotes testing an app “the way users interact with it.” What are some query examples that best reflect how users find elements?**
5. **When testing forms, what essential user behaviors should your tests simulate to match real-world usage?**
6. **Why is mocking HTTP requests necessary in unit/integration tests, and how does MSW improve the mocking process compared to manual Jest mocks?**
7. **Jest runs tests in a Node.js environment using JSDOM. Which browser APIs are not fully supported and often need to be mocked manually?**
8. **Why is mocking browser APIs considered “poking a hole in reality”? Which types of tests should minimize mocking when possible?**
9. **Why is the recommended way to test custom React hooks to wrap them in a test component instead of calling the hook directly?**
10. **When testing components that rely on React Context, what problem does a custom `render` function solve?**

## JavaScript

1. **What is a closure in JavaScript, and how is it used in real-world applications?**
2. **What is debouncing, and how does it work internally using closures?**
3. **What is the JavaScript event loop, and how does it schedule synchronous code, microtasks (Promises), and macrotasks (setTimeout)?**
4. **What are common asynchronous patterns in JavaScript, and when should you use callbacks, Promises, or `async/await`?**
5. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**

## TypeScript

1. **What are the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript?**
2. **What are interfaces and types in TypeScript, and when should you use each?**
3. **How does TypeScript improve code safety at compile time?**
4. **What are generic types in TypeScript?**

## Patterns

1. **How does the composition pattern help reduce prop drilling, and what is its main benefit for component flexibility?**
2. **Why would you store the “latest value” in `useRef` instead of state when dealing with async logic or callbacks?**
3. **What does React Context enable in the compound components pattern, and why is this pattern useful?**
4. **What problem does the slot pattern solve when a child component is not a direct descendant of its parent?**
5. **What is the advantage of a prop getter over prop collection when exposing a custom hook API?**
6. **Why does the state initializer pattern store the initial value in `useRef` instead of recomputing it on every render?**
7. **How does the state reducer pattern allow consumers to customize state transitions without modifying internal logic?**
8. **How should a component determine whether it is controlled or uncontrolled based on its props?**
9. **Which pattern would you use to block or modify specific state changes, and why?**

## CSS

1. **What is responsive web design, and why is it important?**
2. **How do you optimize a website for accessibility (a11y)?**
3. **What are CSS pre-processors, and how do features like variables, nesting, and mixins (e.g., in Sass or Less) improve maintainability and scalability in large applications?**

## Others

1. **Can you describe your CI/CD experience?**
2. **How do you structure a scalable frontend project?**
3. **How do you work within an Agile team?**
4. **What are Single Page Applications (SPAs), and what are their advantages?**
