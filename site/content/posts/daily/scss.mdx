> A CSS pre-processor (like **SASS/SCSS** or **LESS**) extends plain CSS with features such as **variables, nesting, mixins, and functions**. These features make styles more **maintainable and reusable**, especially as a React app grows.

### Why use a pre-processor in React?

React focuses on **component-based UI**, and pre-processors help keep styles organized and consistent across components.

**Key benefits**

* **Variables** → centralize colors, spacing, breakpoints
* **Nesting** → mirror component structure
* **Mixins** → reuse common patterns (buttons, flex utilities)
* **Cleaner maintenance** → fewer repeated rules

### Typical setup in React

Most modern setups (Vite, CRA, Next.js) support SCSS out of the box.

```bash
npm install sass
```

Use it per component:

```jsx
import "./Button.scss";

function Button() {
  return <button className="btn">Save</button>;
}
```

```scss
// Button.scss
$primary: #3b82f6;

.btn {
  background: $primary;
  color: white;

  &:hover {
    opacity: 0.9;
  }
}
```

### Where CSS Pre-processors shine

✅ Migrating or maintaining **legacy CSS**
✅ **Design-heavy** apps with many custom styles
✅ Teams comfortable with traditional CSS workflows
✅ Complex animations or shared styling logic
