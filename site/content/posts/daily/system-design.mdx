> **“Design a scalable frontend for a large web application (e.g. dashboard, e-commerce, chat app)”**

## 1. Clarify requirements

> “Before jumping into the design, I’d like to clarify the requirements.”

* Who are the users?
* Core features?
* Real-time? Offline?
* Desktop / mobile / both?
* Scale? (10k users vs millions)


### 2. High-level architecture

> “The app is a SPA served via CDN. It communicates with backend services through APIs, and we cache data on the client to reduce unnecessary requests.”

* **SPA** (React / Vue)
* **CDN** for static assets
* **API layer** (REST / GraphQL)
* **Client-side caching**
* **State management**

### 3. App structure

> “I prefer feature-based architecture because it scales better and reduces coupling.”

**Feature-based structure**

```
/features
  /auth
  /dashboard
  /settings
/shared
  /components
  /hooks
```

### 4. State management strategy

> “I separate server state from UI state to avoid overusing global stores.”

| Type         | Solution          |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| UI state     | Local state       |
| Global state | Redux / Zustand   |
| Server data  | React Query / SWR |
| Auth         | Context + storage |

### 5. Performance optimization

> “Initial load is optimized using code splitting and lazy loading, while frequently used data is cached.”

* Code splitting
* Lazy loading
* Memoization
* Virtualization (large lists)
* Image optimization

### 6. Security considerations 

> “Sensitive tokens are stored securely and never exposed directly to JavaScript.”

* XSS protection
* CSRF tokens
* HTTPS
* Secure storage (no sensitive data in localStorage)
* Content Security Policy (CSP)


### 7. Error handling & UX

> “Even when APIs fail, the UI should fail gracefully and guide the user.”

* Global error boundary
* Loading skeletons
* Retry logic
* Graceful degradation
