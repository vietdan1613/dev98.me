* Design a **scalable frontend architecture**
* Handle **performance**, **state**, and **UX**
* Think in **trade-offs**

> **“Design a scalable frontend for a large web application (e.g. dashboard, e-commerce, chat app)”**

## 1️⃣ Clarify requirements

Start by:

* Who are the users?
* Core features?
* Real-time? Offline?
* Desktop / mobile / both?
* Scale? (10k users vs millions)

💬 Interview phrase:

> “Before jumping into the design, I’d like to clarify the requirements.”

---

### 2️⃣ High-level architecture

Explain something like:

* **SPA** (React / Vue)
* **CDN** for static assets
* **API layer** (REST / GraphQL)
* **Client-side caching**
* **State management**

💬 Example:

> “The app is a SPA served via CDN. It communicates with backend services through APIs, and we cache data on the client to reduce unnecessary requests.”

---

### 3️⃣ App structure

Explain how you organize code:

**Feature-based structure**

```
/features
  /auth
  /dashboard
  /settings
/shared
  /components
  /hooks
```

💬 Interview line:

> “I prefer feature-based architecture because it scales better and reduces coupling.”

---

### 4️⃣ State management strategy

Explain **when to use what**:

| Type         | Solution          |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| UI state     | Local state       |
| Global state | Redux / Zustand   |
| Server data  | React Query / SWR |
| Auth         | Context + storage |

💬 Strong answer:

> “I separate server state from UI state to avoid overusing global stores.”

---

### 5️⃣ Performance optimization

Mention:

* Code splitting
* Lazy loading
* Memoization
* Virtualization (large lists)
* Image optimization

💬 Interview sentence:

> “Initial load is optimized using code splitting and lazy loading, while frequently used data is cached.”

---

### 6️⃣ Security considerations 

* XSS protection
* CSRF tokens
* HTTPS
* Secure storage (no sensitive data in localStorage)
* Content Security Policy (CSP)

💬 Example:

> “Sensitive tokens are stored securely and never exposed directly to JavaScript.”

---

### 7️⃣ Error handling & UX

* Global error boundary
* Loading skeletons
* Retry logic
* Graceful degradation

💬 Good line:

> “Even when APIs fail, the UI should fail gracefully and guide the user.”
