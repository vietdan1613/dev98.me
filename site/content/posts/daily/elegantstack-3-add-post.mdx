## ✅ **1. Adding a Post**

Each post has its own folder inside:

```
site/content/posts/
```

### Folder name recommendation

Use a date prefix to keep things organized:

```
site/content/posts/2025-11-13-my-first-post/
```

Inside each post folder, add:

### Required files:

* **index.mdx** ← your article
* **image.jpg** ← thumbnail + cover image

### Example folder:

```
site/content/posts/why-gatsby-is-our-favorite-site-generator/
│── index.mdx
└── image.jpg
```

### Example `index.mdx`:

```mdx

## Hello World! Blogging with Gatsby is fun.

This is your post content — you can add **headings**, **images**, **code blocks**, etc.
```

✔ `author` must match an author JSON
✔ `category` must match a category JSON
✔ `thumbnail` must be in the same folder

---

Below is a **clear, beginner-friendly English explanation** of how to embed **images and videos** in FlexiBlog posts using Markdown.
You can use this as part of your documentation or video script.

---

FlexiBlog uses **Markdown (.md or .mdx)** files for creating posts.
This makes adding images and videos extremely simple.

---

## 🖼️ **1. Adding Images to Posts**

### ✔ **1.1 Inline Image**

This method puts the image and link in the same line.

```
![Photo by Mads Schmidt Rasmussen](./image-markdown.jpg "Photo by Mads Schmidt Rasmussen on Unsplash")
```

### 📌 How it works:

* `![]` → tells Markdown to display an image
* inside the brackets: alt text
* inside parentheses: image path + optional title
* `./image-markdown.jpg` means the image is stored in the **same folder as your Markdown file**

### Example folder:

```
/content/posts/my-post
   index.md
   image-markdown.jpg
```

This keeps everything organized.

---

### ✔ **1.2 Reference-Style Image**

Cleaner and easier for long posts:

```
![Photo by Mads Schmidt Rasmussen][photo]

[photo]: ./image-markdown.jpg "Photo by Mads Schmidt Rasmussen on Unsplash"
```

This splits the image reference and the link.

---

## 🎥 **2. Embedding Videos in Posts**

FlexiBlog includes **gatsby-remark-embed-video**, allowing you to embed videos from:

✔ YouTube
✔ Vimeo
✔ Twitch
✔ And many more

You simply paste a special embed line inside your Markdown file.

---

### ✔ **2.1 Embed a YouTube Video**

```

```

---

### ✔ **2.2 Embed a Vimeo Video**

```
