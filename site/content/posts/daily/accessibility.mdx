Web accessibility is no longer optional—it’s a fundamental part of building modern, inclusive web applications. While becoming an accessibility expert takes time, frontend developers are often expected to have an **intermediate understanding of WCAG 2.0 Level AA** and apply accessibility best practices in everyday development.

This article covers the **core accessibility concepts** every frontend developer should be comfortable with.

## 1. Semantic HTML: The Foundation of Accessibility

Semantic HTML provides meaning to web content, not just structure. Elements like `<button>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<label>` communicate intent to assistive technologies such as screen readers.

**Why it matters:**

* Screen readers rely on semantic elements to announce content correctly.
* Native elements come with built-in keyboard and accessibility support.
* Reduces the need for extra ARIA attributes.

**Best practice:**
Always prefer semantic HTML over generic `<div>` and `<span>` elements.

## 2. Keyboard Accessibility: Designing Beyond the Mouse

Not all users navigate with a mouse. Some rely entirely on keyboards or assistive devices.

**Key things to ensure:**

* All interactive elements are reachable via the `Tab` key
* Logical and predictable focus order
* Clear and visible focus indicators
* No keyboard traps (users can always tab away)

**Tip:**
Test your application by navigating it using only the keyboard—no mouse allowed.

## 3. Color Contrast: Readability for Everyone

WCAG Level AA defines minimum contrast ratios to ensure text is readable for users with visual impairments.

**Contrast requirements:**

* **4.5:1** for normal text
* **3:1** for large text and UI elements

**Tools you can use:**

* Browser DevTools
* Lighthouse
* Online contrast checkers

Good contrast improves usability not just for accessibility users, but for everyone.

## 4. Accessible Forms: Clear, Usable, and Error-Friendly

Forms are one of the most common interaction points—and one of the easiest places to introduce accessibility issues.

**Accessibility essentials for forms:**

* Every input must have a visible and associated `<label>`
* Error messages should be descriptive and easy to understand
* Errors should be announced to screen readers
* Required fields should be clearly indicated

**Avoid:**
Using placeholders as replacements for labels.

## 5. ARIA Basics: Use It Carefully

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) helps when native HTML isn’t enough—but it should not replace semantic HTML.

**Golden rule:**

> Use native HTML first. Use ARIA only when necessary.

**Common ARIA use cases:**

* Custom components (e.g., custom dropdowns or modals)
* Dynamic content updates
* Managing accessibility states (`aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`)

Incorrect ARIA usage can make accessibility worse, not better.

---

## 6. Alt Text for Images: Meaning Over Description

Alternative text (`alt`) allows screen reader users to understand the purpose of images.

**Guidelines:**

* Informative images need meaningful alt text
* Decorative images should have empty alt text (`alt=""`)
* Avoid phrases like “image of” or “picture of”

Alt text should describe **why the image is there**, not just what it looks like.

---

## 7. Focus Management: Especially for Modals and Dropdowns

Dynamic UI elements can easily break accessibility if focus isn’t managed properly.

**Good focus management includes:**

* Moving focus into a modal when it opens
* Trapping focus inside the modal
* Returning focus to the trigger element when closed
* Supporting keyboard shortcuts like `Esc`

This is especially important in React applications with custom UI components.

## Conclusion

You don’t need to memorize every WCAG rule to build accessible applications. An intermediate understanding—applied consistently—is enough to make a real impact.

By focusing on:

* Semantic HTML
* Keyboard navigation
* Visual contrast
* Accessible forms
* Careful ARIA usage
* Meaningful alt text
* Proper focus management

you’ll be building interfaces that are **more inclusive, more usable, and more professional**.

Accessibility is not just about compliance—it’s about building better software for everyone.
