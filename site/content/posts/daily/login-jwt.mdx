> **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

JWTs are commonly used for **authentication and authorization** in modern web applications.

JWT is widely adopted in APIs, SPAs, and microservice architectures because it is:

* **Stateless** – no server-side session storage required
* **Compact** – small size, efficient to send via HTTP headers
* **Self-contained** – carries user identity and metadata
* **Scalable** – works well with distributed systems

## Structure

A JWT consists of **three parts**, separated by dots (`.`):

```
header.payload.signature
```

Each part is Base64URL-encoded.

### 1. Header

The header describes the token type and the signing algorithm.

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

* `alg`: signing algorithm (HS256, RS256, etc.)
* `typ`: token type (JWT)

### 2. Payload 

The payload contains **claims**, which are statements about the user and additional metadata.

There are three types of claims:

* **Registered claims** (standard):

  * `iss` (issuer)
  * `sub` (subject / user id)
  * `exp` (expiration time)
  * `aud` (audience)

* **Public claims**
  Custom but globally agreed-upon fields.

* **Private claims**
  Custom fields shared between specific systems (e.g. `role`, `email`).

⚠️ Important: The payload is **not encrypted**, only encoded.

### 3. Signature

The signature ensures the token has not been altered.

Example (HS256):

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```

The server verifies the signature to confirm the token is valid and trustworthy.

## How Its Work

1. **User logs in** with credentials
2. **Server validates credentials** and generates a JWT
3. **Client stores the token** (cookie or memory)
4. **Client sends JWT** in every request:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```
5. **Server verifies the token** and grants access
