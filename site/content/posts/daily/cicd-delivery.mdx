> CI/CD is a DevOps practice that automates building, testing, and deploying code so teams can deliver changes faster, safer, and with confidence

# What Is CI/CD?

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Developers frequently push code to a shared Git repository (such as GitHub or GitLab). Each push triggers automated checks such as:

* Installing dependencies
* Running unit or integration tests
* Building the application

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

Once the code passes CI, it is automatically prepared for release. The application is always in a **deployable state**, and releases can happen safely at any time.

### Continuous Deployment

The final step: every change that passes automated checks is **deployed automatically** to production — no manual steps required.

# Why Git + Vercel?

Git and Vercel form a lightweight yet production-ready CI/CD setup.

**Git provides:**

* Version control
* Collaboration through pull requests
* A trigger point for CI pipelines

**Vercel provides:**

* Automatic deployments on every push
* Preview deployments for pull requests
* Built-in build and runtime optimizations
* Easy rollbacks

Together, they enable a seamless developer experience.

### High-Level CI/CD Flow

Here’s a typical workflow using Git and Vercel:

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions (CI) runs tests and builds the project
3. If CI passes, Vercel automatically deploys the app
4. A preview URL is generated for pull requests
5. Production is updated on merge to `main`

# Setup Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your Git Repository

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your project code
3. Create a `main` branch for production
4. (Optional) Create a `develop` branch for staging

Use pull requests to merge changes safely.

### Step 2: Add a CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions

Create a file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
```

This workflow:

* Runs on every push and pull request
* Installs dependencies
* Runs tests
* Builds the app

If any step fails, the pipeline stops.

### Step 3: Connect Your Repo to Vercel

1. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Choose your framework (Next.js, React, etc.)
4. Set environment variables if needed
5. Deploy

Vercel will now:

* Deploy every push to `main` to production
* Create preview deployments for pull requests

### Step 4: Configure Vercel for CI/CD

You can let GitHub Actions handle CI and let Vercel handle CD.

Or you can add deployment steps into GitHub Actions using the Vercel CLI.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Vercel
  run: npx vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```
