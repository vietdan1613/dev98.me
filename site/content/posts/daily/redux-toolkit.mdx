> Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the **official, recommended way** to write Redux logic. It keeps Redux’s core ideas while removing unnecessary boilerplate and enforcing best practices.

### Why Redux Toolkit?

Classic Redux was powerful but verbose:

* Too many files
* Manual immutability
* Complex store setup

Redux Toolkit fixes this by providing **opinionated defaults** and **simpler APIs**.

## `createSlice`

Defines **state + reducers + actions** in one place.

```ts
const slice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.value++
    },
  },
})
```

✔ No action types
✔ No switch statements

### Safe Mutations

RTK lets you “mutate” state in reducers.
Behind the scenes, **Immer** converts it to immutable updates.

## `configureStore`

Replaces `createStore` and gives you:

* Redux DevTools enabled
* Default middleware
* Safer configuration

```ts
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: slice.reducer },
})
```

## `createAsyncThunk`

Best for **simple async flows** (CRUD, single API calls).

```ts
export const fetchData = createAsyncThunk(
  'data/fetch',
  async () => fetch('/api').then(r => r.json())
)
```

## Best Practices

* Organize Redux by **feature**, not by type
* Keep components thin
* Use RTK for state, Saga for side effects
* Don’t store everything in Redux
