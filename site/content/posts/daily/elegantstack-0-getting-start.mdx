This guide will help you install FlexiBlog, set up your tools, and run your blog locally — even if you have zero coding experience.

---

## 🧩 **1. Install the Required Tools**

Before installing the FlexiBlog theme, you need 3 things:

---

### ✔ 1.1 **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

VS Code is the text editor you will use to open and edit your blog files.

Download it here:
👉 [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install it like any normal application.

**Recommended extensions for beginners:**

* Prettier — Code Formatter
* ESLint
* GitLens
* Markdown Preview Enhanced

> You don’t need to understand coding to use VS Code. Think of it like “Microsoft Word but for websites.”

---

### ✔ 1.2 **Install Node.js**

Download here:
👉 [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

After installation, check if it works:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see version numbers.

---

### ✔ 1.3 **Install Gatsby CLI**

Gatsby is the framework used by FlexiBlog.

Install globally:

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

---

## 🗂️ **2. Unzip the FlexiBlog Theme**

1. Download the ZIP file from ThemeForest
2. Unzip it
3. Open your Terminal / Command Prompt
4. Navigate into the extracted folder:

```
cd @elegantstack
```

(Your folder name may vary.)

---

## 🎨 **3. Create a New Gatsby Site Using a FlexiBlog Starter**

Each starter is a different design. Choose one you like.

#### Example: Create a **Personal Blog** starter

```
gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-personal
```

#### Other available starters:

| Starter    | Command                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agency     | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-agency     |
| Beauty     | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-beauty     |
| Education  | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-education  |
| Medical    | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-medical    |
| Minimal    | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-minimal    |
| Minimal-v2 | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-minimal-v2 |
| News       | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-news       |
| Personal   | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-personal   |
| Science    | gatsby new site ./starters/gatsby-starter-flexiblog-science    |

> Tip: You only need ONE starter. Choose the one closest to the style you want.

---

## ⚙️ **4. Open the Project in VS Code**

After the starter is created:

```
cd site
```

Now open it in VS Code:

```
code .
```

VS Code will open the whole blog project.

---

## 🚀 **5. Run the Development Server**

Start the live preview of your site:

```
npm run develop
```

Open your browser and visit:

👉 **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**

You will now see your blog running!
