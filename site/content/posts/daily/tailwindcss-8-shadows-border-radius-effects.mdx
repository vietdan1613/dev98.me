## 🎯 What You Will Learn

| Utility         | Purpose                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `rounded`       | Control the corner radius of elements |
| `shadow`        | Add depth to elements                 |
| `ring`          | Add focus/outline effects             |
| `backdrop-blur` | Create glass-like blur effects        |

Let’s go step-by-step.

## 🟣 Rounded Corners (`rounded`)

Rounded corners are essential for modern UI design.

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded">Small rounded corners</div>
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">Large rounded corners</div>
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-full">Fully circular (badges, avatars)</div>
```

### Common corner values:

| Class          | Look                 |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| `rounded-sm`   | Slight               |
| `rounded`      | Default medium       |
| `rounded-lg`   | Smooth rounded       |
| `rounded-xl`   | Extra smooth         |
| `rounded-full` | Circle / pill shaped |

## 🌗 Shadows (`shadow`)

Shadows help create **depth and elevation**, making UI look layered and dynamic.

```html
<div class="p-6 bg-white rounded shadow">Subtle shadow</div>
<div class="p-6 bg-white rounded shadow-md">Medium depth</div>
<div class="p-6 bg-white rounded shadow-lg">Large soft shadow</div>
```

### Tip:

Use light shadows for UI that feels minimal and calm.

## 🟡 Rings (`ring`)

Rings are *outer outlines* useful for focus states — especially for inputs and buttons.

```html
<input
  class="p-2 border rounded focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-400"
/>
```

This provides clear feedback, improving **accessibility** and user experience.

---

## 🌫 Glass / Blur Effect (`backdrop-blur`)

This utility creates a **frosted glass** effect — perfect for modals and overlay sections.

```html
<div class="backdrop-blur bg-white/30 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  Glass effect content
</div>
```

💎 You’ll see this style in modern UI like Apple and macOS design.

## 🧪 Mini Demo: Modern Profile Card

Combine everything we learned:

```html
<div class="max-w-xs mx-auto p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md text-center">
  <img
    src="https://i.pravatar.cc/100"
    class="w-24 h-24 rounded-full mx-auto mb-4"
  />
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-1">Alex Johnson</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-500 mb-4">Frontend Developer</p>

  <button
    class="px-4 py-2 bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-lg transition duration-300"
  >
    Follow
  </button>
</div>
```

### What makes this UI look great:

| Utility                       | Impact                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `rounded-xl` + `rounded-full` | Smooth, modern corners      |
| `shadow-md`                   | Subtle depth and contrast   |
| `text-gray-500`               | Soft typography tone        |
| `hover:bg-indigo-600`         | Smooth interactive feedback |

This is a simple component that **looks professional instantly**.
