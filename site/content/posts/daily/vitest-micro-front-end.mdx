**Micro Frontends** split a large frontend into **independently developed and deployed apps**. Combined with **Vite** and **Module Federation**, this approach enables fast builds, team autonomy, and scalable frontend architecture.

## What is a Micro Frontend?

A **Micro Frontend** is an architectural pattern where each UI domain is built, tested, and deployed separately, then composed at runtime by a **host application**.
This helps teams:

* Move faster
* Reduce coupling
* Scale independently

---

## Module Federation (in short)

**Module Federation** allows one app to **dynamically load modules from another app at runtime**, while **sharing dependencies** like React to avoid duplication.

With Vite, this is enabled via:

```
@originjs/vite-plugin-federation
```

---

## Why Vite?

* ⚡ Extremely fast dev server
* 🧩 Simple configuration
* 🚀 Ideal for micro-frontend workflows
* 🛠 Works well with modern React setups

---

## Architecture Overview

* **Host App**: Main container users interact with
* **Remote App**: Exposes reusable components (micro frontend)

```
Host App
 └── loads → Remote Components (via remoteEntry.js)
```

---

## Implementation Steps (High Level)

### 1. Create Apps

```bash
npm create vite@latest host-app -- --template react
npm create vite@latest todo-components -- --template react
npm install
```

---

### 2. Build Remote Components

Expose reusable UI from the remote app:

* `Input.jsx`
* `List.jsx`

---

### 3. Add Module Federation (Remote)

```js
federation({
  name: "todo-components",
  filename: "remoteEntry.js",
  exposes: {
    "./List": "./src/components/List.jsx",
    "./Input": "./src/components/Input.jsx",
  },
  shared: ["react"],
})
```

Build and serve:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

### 4. Add Module Federation (Host)

```js
federation({
  name: "host-app",
  remotes: {
    todo_components: "http://localhost:4173/assets/remoteEntry.js",
  },
  shared: ["react"],
})
```

---

### 5. Use Remote Components

```js
import Input from "todo_components/Input";
import List from "todo_components/List";
```

Remote components now behave like **local imports**.

---

## Key Benefits

* ✅ Independent deployments
* ✅ Faster team velocity
* ✅ Shared dependencies
* ✅ Clean separation of concerns

---

## When to Use (and When Not)

**Good fit when:**

* Multiple teams
* Large, evolving frontend
* Independent release cycles

**Avoid when:**

* Small apps
* Tight coupling required
* Overhead outweighs benefits
