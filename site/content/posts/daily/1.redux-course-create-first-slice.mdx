Now it’s finally time to **start coding with Redux Toolkit**.
In this lesson, we’ll learn:

* What a **Slice** is
* How to use `createSlice()`
* How actions and reducers work in Redux Toolkit
* How to create and configure the global **store**
* How to connect Redux to React using the **Provider**
* And finally, we’ll build a **small Counter feature** to test everything works

## 🔥 What is a Slice?

In Redux Toolkit, a **slice** represents a section of your application's state.

Each Slice contains:

* The state for that feature
* The reducers that modify that state
* Automatically generated action creators

It’s called a *slice* because it represents a **slice of the global state tree**.

### Example:

`counterSlice` → manages count
`pokemonSlice` → manages Pokémon list
`userSlice` → manages user profile

## 🪓 `createSlice()` — The Core of RTK

Redux Toolkit provides a helper called `createSlice()` that lets us define:

* The initial state
* Named reducer functions
* Action creators (generated automatically)

---

## 🧱 Step 1 — Create a Counter Slice

Create a new folder:

```
src/features/counter/counterSlice.js
```

Then add:

```jsx
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

### What just happened?

| Part             | Meaning                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **name**         | Identifier for this piece of state             |
| **initialState** | Default value for this slice                   |
| **reducers**     | Functions that change the state                |
| **actions**      | Automatically generated based on reducer names |

Redux Toolkit uses **Immer** so we can write `state.value += 1` directly (mutating syntax is allowed safely).

## 🏪 Step 2 — Set Up the Store

Create the store file:

```
src/store.js
```

```jsx
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

---

## 🔗 Step 3 — Wrap React App with Provider

Open your `main.jsx` (Vite) or `index.js` (CRA):

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```

This gives the **entire app** access to the Redux store.

---

## 🎮 Step 4 — Use the Counter in the UI

Open `App.jsx` and modify it:

```jsx
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment, decrement } from "./features/counter/counterSlice";

function App() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "50px" }}>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())} style={{ marginLeft: "10px" }}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
