**React 19 introduces `useActionState()`**, a new Hook that simplifies form logic by tightly integrating **server actions** with **client state**.

## Why We Needed `useActionState()`

Before React 19, handling forms usually involved:

* `useState` for form state
* `useState` for loading
* `try/catch` for errors
* Manual syncing with server responses

This often led to **boilerplate-heavy code** and fragile state handling.

`useActionState()` solves this by:

* Binding state directly to an **action**
* Automatically tracking **pending state**
* Returning **server results or errors** cleanly

---

## What Is `useActionState()`?

```ts
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(
  action,
  initialState
);
```

It accepts:

* **`action`** → an async function (usually a server action)
* **`initialState`** → initial form state

And returns:

* **`state`** → latest result from the action
* **`formAction`** → function to attach to `<form action={...}>`
* **`isPending`** → loading state (true while submitting)

---

## Basic Example: Login Form

```tsx
import { useActionState } from "react";
import { loginAction } from "./actions/login";

const initialState = { error: null, success: false };

export default function LoginForm() {
  const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(
    loginAction,
    initialState
  );

  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      <input name="email" placeholder="Email" />
      <input name="password" type="password" placeholder="Password" />

      <button disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? "Logging in..." : "Login"}
      </button>

      {state.error && <p>{state.error}</p>}
      {state.success && <p>Login successful!</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

## `useActionState()` vs `useState()`

| Feature             | useState | useActionState |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Async form handling | ❌        | ✅              |
| Server integration  | ❌        | ✅              |
| Pending state       | Manual   | Built-in       |
| Boilerplate         | High     | Low            |
