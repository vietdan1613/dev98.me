**🧪 Mocking HTTP Requests in React Tests: The MSW Way**

When you're writing tests for a frontend application, one of the biggest questions is:

> “How do I test components that make HTTP requests?”

The answer depends on the kind of test you're writing. For **end-to-end (E2E) tests**, it’s ideal to interact with a **real backend** or a **mocked backend** running in the background. But for **unit and integration tests** (especially those run in Jest), mocking HTTP requests is often the most practical approach.

That’s where **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** comes in—a powerful library that intercepts network requests in tests and returns mock responses, just like a real server would.

Let’s dive into how and why to use MSW to mock `fetch` in your Jest tests.

---

## 🌐 Why Mock HTTP Requests?

When testing user interactions that involve network requests (e.g., form submissions, data fetching), it’s important to:

* ✅ Simulate realistic behavior
* ✅ Keep tests fast and reliable
* ✅ Avoid relying on real APIs or external services

While tools like [Cypress](https://cypress.io) are perfect for full-blown E2E testing, **Jest** is better suited for faster unit and integration tests.

So for our React tests, we’ll **mock network requests using MSW**, ensuring:

* No need for a real server
* No flaky network delays
* High test confidence without losing speed

---

## 🛠️ Setting Up MSW in Jest

Imagine a component called `<Fetch />` that requests data from `/greeting` and displays the result.

Here's how we can test it:

```js
// __tests__/fetch.test.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { render, waitForElementToBeRemoved, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import Fetch from '../fetch'

const server = setupServer(
  http.post('/greeting', async ({ request }) => {
    const data = await request.json() 
    const { username, password } = data
    return HttpResponse.json({ username: username })
  })
)

beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())
afterAll(() => server.close())

test('loads and displays greeting', async () => {
  render(<Fetch url="/greeting" />)

  await userEvent.click(screen.getByText('Load Greeting'))

  await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => screen.getByText('Loading...'))

  expect(screen.getByRole('heading')).toHaveTextContent('hello there')
  expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveAttribute('disabled')
})
```

✅ `setupServer` creates an in-memory mock server
✅ `http.get()` defines a mock handler for a GET request to `/greeting`
✅ `server.listen()` activates it for tests
✅ `waitForElementToBeRemoved` waits for loading state to disappear
✅ `screen.getByRole` interacts just like a user would

---
## 💯 Extra Credit: Make Your Mocking Even Better

### 1. ✅ Reuse Centralized Server Handlers

If you already have a set of reusable MSW handlers (e.g., `test/server-handlers.js`), reuse them:

```js
import { handlers } from '../test/server-handlers'
const server = setupServer(...handlers)
```

This allows:

* Shared mock logic between dev and test
* Offline-friendly development
* Faster prototyping with unfinished APIs

> 📘 MSW was originally created for local development mocks—not just testing!

---

### 2. 🚨 Test the Unhappy Path

Don’t forget to test what happens when the user **submits invalid input** or **leaves a field empty**.

Example: leave the password field blank in a login form and verify that the error message appears.

```js
await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/username/i), 'admin')
// Don't type in the password field

await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }))

expect(screen.getByRole('alert')).toHaveTextContent(/password is required/i)
```

---

### 3. 🧪 Use Inline Snapshots

Manually copying error message strings can be a pain. Instead, use **inline snapshots**:

```js
expect(screen.getByRole('alert').textContent).toMatchInlineSnapshot(
  `"Oops, something went wrong!"`,
)
```

This saves you from hardcoding strings and automatically updates with Jest if the error changes (with your approval).

---

### 4. 🛠 Use One-Off Server Handlers

What if you want to simulate a **server crash** or random failure **only for one test**?

Use **`server.use()`** with a custom response handler:

```js
server.use(
        http.post('/greeting', async () => {
            await delay(1000) // Simulate network delay
            return HttpResponse.json(
                { message: err_message },
                { status: 500 }
            )
        })
    )
```

This local override avoids:

* Cluttering global handlers
* Breaking other unrelated tests
* Confusing future readers

🧠 Think of it as "test-local mocking" — focused and isolated.
