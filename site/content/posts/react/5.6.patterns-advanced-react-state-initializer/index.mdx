**🔁 The State Initializer Pattern in React: Resetting with Confidence**

<callout-success>
<strong>One-liner:</strong> The <strong>State Initializer</strong> pattern allows you to initialize—and reliably reset—component state to its original value without surprises.
</callout-success>

One of the fundamental building blocks of React is `useState()`. But sometimes, initializing state is only half the story—you also want a way to **reset** it.

The problem? Without proper care, that reset may not behave how you think it should.

Let’s dig into the *State Initializer* pattern, how to implement it correctly, and where it can go wrong. 🧠

---

## 🏁 The Basic Hook

Let’s start simple with a `useCounter` hook:

```tsx
function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)

  return { count, increment }
}
```

Nothing special. It just counts. But what if we want to let users set the starting value?

---

## 🎚️ Adding Initial State

We can allow for configuration like this:

```tsx
function useCounter({ initialCount = 0 } = {}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)

  return { count, increment }
}
```

Now you can start your counter at `10`, `50`, or any value:

```tsx
const { count } = useCounter({ initialCount: 10 })
```

Great! But now comes the kicker...

---

## 🔄 What About Reset?

We want to let users *reset* the count back to that initial value. That means we need to keep track of the original value:

```tsx
function useCounter({ initialCount = 0 } = {}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)

  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  const reset = () => setCount(initialCount)

  return { count, increment, reset }
}
```

So what’s wrong with that?

### ⚠️ The Gotcha

Let’s say a parent component re-renders and **passes a new `initialCount`** value. Your hook will use the *new* value for resets—not the *original one*. 😬

That’s not what most people expect. The term “reset” implies going back to the state at the time the component was initialized—not the current value of the prop.

---

## 🧷 Locking in Initial State with Refs

The solution? Use a `ref` to capture the initial value once—and never let it change:

```tsx
function useCounter({ initialCount = 0 } = {}) {
  const initialCountRef = useRef(initialCount)
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCountRef.current)

  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  const reset = () => setCount(initialCountRef.current)

  return { count, increment, reset }
}
```

🧠 `useRef` stores a value that persists across renders *without* causing re-renders. It’s perfect for capturing “once-on-mount” values like this.

---

## 🧪 Real Example: useToggle with Reducer

This pattern gets even more important when you manage state with a `reducer`. Here’s a simplified `useToggle` hook:

```tsx
function toggleReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'toggle': return { ...state, on: !state.on }
    case 'reset': return { ...state, on: action.initialOn }
    default: throw new Error('Unhandled action type')
  }
}
```

And here’s the hook implementation:

```tsx
function useToggle({ initialOn = false } = {}) {
  const initialOnRef = useRef(initialOn)

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(toggleReducer, {
    on: initialOnRef.current,
  })

  const toggle = () => dispatch({ type: 'toggle' })
  const reset = () => dispatch({ type: 'reset', initialOn: initialOnRef.current })

  return { on: state.on, toggle, reset }
}
```

Now no matter how `initialOn` changes later from a parent component, your reset behavior is **locked in** to the original value passed.

---

## 🧪 When It Breaks: Resetting with Changing Initial State

Let’s say we do this:

```tsx
function Parent() {
  const [isDarkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(true)

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setDarkMode(prev => !prev)}>Toggle Initial</button>
      <Toggle initialOn={isDarkMode} />
    </>
  )
}
```

Now if the user toggles `isDarkMode` and then hits reset in the `Toggle` component...

### ❌ Without `useRef`: Reset will use the *current* `isDarkMode`, not the original.

### ✅ With `useRef`: Reset will go back to the original `isDarkMode` value.

This difference is subtle but can lead to serious bugs—especially when components are reused or toggled conditionally.

## ✅ Best Practices for the State Initializer Pattern

| Do                                                | Don’t                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use `useRef` to lock in initial state             | Don’t trust current `initialX` values after mount            |
| Combine with `useReducer` for complex state logic | Avoid repeating the same `initialX` logic in multiple places |
| Name your initializer and reset methods clearly   | Don’t rely on `useEffect` to “patch” initialization          |

## 🧠 When to Use the State Initializer Pattern

Use this pattern whenever your component:

* Accepts an “initial” value
* Has a **reset** button or logic
* Should not be influenced by future prop changes to the initial value

Some examples:

* Form inputs that reset to defaults
* Toggle switches that return to a default mode
* Games or counters that reset to starting values

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

The **State Initializer Pattern** is simple but powerful. By using `useRef`, you can avoid subtle bugs and make your components more predictable—especially in dynamic or complex applications.

Reset behavior should feel intuitive. By anchoring to the *original initial value*, you ensure your users (and teammates) always know what to expect.
