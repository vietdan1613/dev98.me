> `useFormStatus` is a React hook that lets you read the **submission state of a form**.

It works by:

* Treating `<form>` as a context provider
* Allowing child components to subscribe to its status
* Eliminating the need to pass loading flags through props

Think of it as:

> “Let every part of the form know when submission is happening — automatically.”

# What Problems Does It Solve?

Without `useFormStatus`, you often write:

```tsx
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false)
```

And manually manage:

* Button disabled states
* Loading labels
* Race conditions
* State cleanup

With `useFormStatus`, React handles this for you — declaratively.

# Disable Submit Button

```tsx
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'

function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus()

  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

✔ No prop drilling.    
✔ Always in sync with form state.    
✔ Prevents duplicate submissions

# How It Works

`useFormStatus` reads the status of the **nearest parent `<form>`**.

That means:

* It only works inside a form
* It automatically updates when the form submits
* It resets when the submission finishes

# Real Example: Login Form UX

```tsx
function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <form action={login}>
      <input name="email" />
      <input name="password" type="password" />
      <SubmitButton />
    </form>
  )
}

function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus()

  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

✔ Clear feedback.   
✔ Prevents double-clicks.   
✔ Improves accessibility.   

# Takeaway

`useFormStatus` doesn’t just simplify forms —
it **standardizes form UX** across your application.

Use it to build forms that feel:

* More responsive
* More accessible
* More professional
