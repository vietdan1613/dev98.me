> `useTransition` lets you mark certain state updates as **non-urgent**, allowing React to keep the UI responsive while those updates are processed in the background.

```tsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()
```

It returns:

* `startTransition` → wraps low-priority updates
* `isPending` → tells you if a transition is in progress

# The Problem 

Without transitions, every update blocks rendering:

```tsx
setFilter(value) // slow update blocks typing
```

If filtering is expensive, the input lags — bad UX.

# The Solution: useTransition

```tsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()

function onChange(e) {
  const value = e.target.value
  startTransition(() => {
    setFilter(value)
  })
}
```

✔ Typing stays smooth.    
✔ Heavy updates run in the background.    
✔ UI feels faster.    

# Takeaway

`useTransition` doesn’t make your code faster —
it makes your UI **feel** faster.

Use it wisely, and your React apps will feel:

* Smoother
* More responsive

Use `useTransition` for:

* Filtering and sorting large lists
* Data-driven navigation
* Switching views or tabs
* Rendering expensive components
