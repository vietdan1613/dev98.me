**🧠 React State Optimization: Avoiding Unnecessary Renders**

React is designed to efficiently update the DOM when your application state changes. But what if you're changing the state to exactly the same value it already holds? Did you know that you can prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance just by being smart about how you update state?

In this post, we’ll explore:

* How React treats state updates
* The gotchas with objects and functions
* How to avoid unnecessary re-renders
* A practical example with `URLSearchParams`

---

## 🔁 How React Handles Repeated State

Let’s start with a simple example using `useState`.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// Somewhere later in the code
setCount(0); // No rerender if `count` is already 0
```

React is smart! If you set the state to the **same primitive value**, it won’t rerender the component. It compares the current value with the new one using `Object.is()` and skips rerendering if they are equal.

---

## 🧩 Objects Are Tricky

Now consider this case:

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useState({ count: 0 });

setState({ count: 0 }); 
```

Even though the values inside are the same, this creates a **new object**, and React sees it as a change — so it rerenders. Why?

Because:

```tsx
{ count: 0 } !== { count: 0 } // different references!
```

You can avoid this by returning the previous state directly if nothing changed:

```tsx
setState((prev) => prev); // No rerender
```

Or by performing a deep comparison yourself if needed.

## 🧠 Tip: Manually Optimize State Updates

Before calling a state update function, you can first **check** whether any value actually changed. If not, just return the previous state. This applies to both `useState` and `useReducer`.

This approach gives you precise control and avoids unnecessary work for React — which can be a huge win for performance in large apps!

---

## 🧪 Practical Example: `URLSearchParams` State

Let’s put this into practice with a real-world scenario:

Imagine a search page where you store the entire `URLSearchParams` object in state — not just the search `query`, but the full set of parameters.

```tsx
const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useState(new URLSearchParams(window.location.search));
```

You have a form where users can submit a search term, and each submission calls:

```tsx
setSearchParams((prevParams) => {
  const newParams = new URLSearchParams(formInput);

  // If the new parameters are identical, skip update
  if (newParams.toString() === prevParams.toString()) {
    return prevParams; // No rerender
  }

  return newParams;
});
```

With this check in place:

* Submitting the same query repeatedly **won’t trigger a rerender**.
* Changing the query **will** update the state and rerender.

💡 Try it out in your browser console:

* Add `console.log('App rerendered')` in your `App` component.
* Add `console.log('Search params updated')` in your `setSearchParams` callback.
* Submit the form multiple times with and without changing the input — watch the logs!

## 🏁 Conclusion

React gives you the tools to write performant applications, but it's up to you to use them wisely. By:

* Understanding how React compares state values,
* Avoiding unnecessary object recreations,
* Manually checking for changes before updating state,

You can significantly reduce unnecessary renders and keep your UI lightning fast.
