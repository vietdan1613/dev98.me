> To feel smooth, browsers aim for **60 frames per second**, giving us only:

React must:

* Reconcile changes
* Render components
* Let the browser paint updates

When React takes too long, users experience:

* Input lag
* Frozen UI

This is where concurrent rendering changes the game.

# What Is Concurrent Rendering?

Concurrent rendering is a new rendering model in React 18 that allows React to:

✅ Start rendering.   
⏸ Pause rendering if it takes too long.   
▶ Resume later.   
🚫 Without blocking user interactions.   

Instead of treating rendering as a single uninterruptible task, React now breaks it into small chunks and yields control back to the browser when needed.

This allows:

* Buttons to stay clickable
* Typing to stay responsive
* Animations to remain smooth

Even during heavy UI updates.

# What Changed in React 18?

Concurrent rendering is not a feature you “turn on” directly — it’s the foundation for new APIs like:

* `useDeferredValue`
* `startTransition`
* `Suspense`
* Streaming SSR

These APIs allow React to **prioritize updates** instead of treating all renders equally.

# Why Prioritization Matters

Not all UI updates are equally important.

Example:

* Typing in a search box → **High priority**
* Rendering 1,000 filtered results → **Low priority**

Without prioritization, React would block typing until all results finish rendering 😵.

Concurrent rendering lets React:

* Update what users care about **first**
* Defer less important work

## Example Concurrent Features

### Using `useDeferredValue`

```tsx
function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <SlowList text={deferredText} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Now:

* Input updates immediately
* Heavy list updates later
* UI feels smooth
