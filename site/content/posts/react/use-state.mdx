`useState` is the most fundamental React Hook. It allows function components to store and update state, making UIs dynamic and interactive.

## What?

`useState` lets a component remember values between renders.

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)
```

It returns:

* The current state value
* A function to update it

### Example

```tsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

> Clicking the button updates the state and re-renders the UI.

## Functional Updates

When new state depends on previous state:

```tsx
setCount(prev => prev + 1)
```

This avoids bugs when updates happen quickly or in batches.

### Objects and Arrays

Always copy state instead of mutating it:

```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "Daniel" })

setUser(prev => ({ ...prev, name: "Alex" }))
```

```tsx
setItems(prev => [...prev, newItem])
```

## Lazy Initialization

For expensive initial state:

```tsx
const [value, setValue] = useState(() => computeInitial())
```

> This runs only once, not on every render.

## Best Practices

✔ Keep state minimal       
✔ Prefer functional updates       
✔ Split unrelated state       
✔ Lift state when needed       
✔ Avoid deeply nested state
