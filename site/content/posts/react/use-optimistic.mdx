> Most user actions succeed, so update the UI first and confirm later.

Example: When a user checks a todo item, we mark it as complete instantly and sync with the server in the background.

✔ Faster feedback.   
✔ Better perceived performance.   
✔ More responsive apps

# Optimism During Transitions

React provides `useOptimistic` to override UI state **while a transition or form action is in progress**.

It behaves like `useState`, but is scoped to a pending transition — perfect for optimistic updates.

### Example: Optimistic Todo Toggle

```tsx
function Todo({ todo }) {
  const [isComplete, setIsComplete] = useOptimistic(todo.isComplete)

  return (
    <form
      action={async () => {
        setIsComplete(!isComplete)           // Optimistic update
        await updateTodo(todo.id, !isComplete) // Server sync
      }}
    >
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" checked={isComplete} />
        {todo.text}
      </label>
    </form>
  )
}
```

✔ UI updates instantly.   
✔ Rolls back automatically if props change.    
✔ No manual error handling required for basic cases

# Optimistic Form Submission

Problem: After submitting a form, users wait before seeing the new data — which feels slow.

Solution:
Render an **optimistic version** of the data instantly.

```tsx
action={async (formData) => {
  const optimisticPokemon = createOptimisticPokemon(formData)
  setOptimisticPokemon(optimisticPokemon)

  const realPokemon = await updatePokemon(formData)
  setSelectedPokemon(realPokemon.name)
  setOptimisticPokemon(null)
}}
```

✔ Shows immediate feedback.    
✔ Replaces with real data later.    

# Multi-Step Optimistic

For actions with multiple steps, `useOptimistic` enables progressive feedback:

```tsx
function CreateForm() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useOptimistic('Create')

  return (
    <form
      action={async (formData) => {
        setMessage('Creating...')
        const pokemon = await updatePokemon(formData)

        setMessage('Saving...')
        await savePokemon(pokemon)

        setMessage('Finalizing...')
        await notifyFleet(pokemon)
      }}
    >
      <SubmitButton message={message} />
    </form>
  )
}
```

✔ Clear progress feedback.   
✔ Keeps users informed.   

# Takeaways

* Use **Optimistic UI** to make apps feel instant
* `useOptimistic` overrides UI state during transitions
* Combine both for smooth, professional UX
* Use placeholders (`"..."`) for fields not yet loaded
