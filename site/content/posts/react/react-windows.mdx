> Rendering large lists in React can seriously hurt performance. Thousands of DOM nodes slow rendering, scrolling, and interactions.

> **`react-window`** solves this with **list virtualization** — rendering only what’s visible on screen.

Without virtualization:

```tsx
items.map(item => <Row key={item.id} />)
```

❌ Renders everything
❌ Heavy DOM
❌ Slow scroll

With `react-window`:

✔ Only visible rows render.   
✔ Tiny DOM.   
✔ Smooth scrolling

### What is `react-window`?

A lightweight library for efficiently rendering large lists and grids by:

* Rendering only visible items
* Reusing DOM nodes
* Minimizing memory usage

Smaller and simpler than `react-virtualized`.

### Quick Example

```tsx
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const Row = ({ index, style }) => (
  <div style={style}>Row {index}</div>
);

function MyList() {
  return (
    <List
      height={400}
      itemCount={10000}
      itemSize={35}
      width="100%"
    >
      {Row}
    </List>
  );
}
```

👉 Only ~10–15 rows are mounted at any time, even for 10,000 items.

### Variable Heights

Use `VariableSizeList` if rows differ in size:

```tsx
<VariableSizeList itemSize={getSize} />
```

⚠️ Call `resetAfterIndex()` when sizes change.
