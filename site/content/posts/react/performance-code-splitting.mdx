> Code splitting breaks your bundle into smaller chunks that load on demand instead of all at once.

> Think: *stream one episode, not the whole season.*

### Lazy Load with `React.lazy` + `Suspense`

```tsx
const SmileyFace = lazy(() => import('./SmileyFace'));

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <SmileyFace />
</Suspense>
```

✔ Component loads only when rendered.   
✔ Smaller initial bundle.   
✔ Faster startup.   

### Load Heavy Features On Demand

Avoid loading expensive libraries (e.g. Three.js) until needed:

```tsx
const Globe = lazy(() => import('./Globe'));

{showGlobe && (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading globe...</div>}>
    <Globe />
  </Suspense>
)}
```

✔ Login page stays fast.    
✔ Globe loads only when user requests it

### Preload on Hover or Focus

If users almost always open the feature, preload it early:

```tsx
const preloadGlobe = () => import('./Globe');

<label onPointerOver={preloadGlobe} onFocus={preloadGlobe}>
```

✔ Starts loading before click.    
✔ Feels instant

### Smooth UX with `useTransition`

Avoid flashing loaders when lazy components load quickly:

```tsx
startTransition(() => setShowGlobe(true));
```

✔ Marks UI update as low priority
✔ Keeps interactions smooth

Optional: use `spin-delay` to prevent flickering loaders.
