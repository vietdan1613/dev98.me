Now that your Next.js project is set up, you'll notice a number of files and folders inside your workspace. At first glance, it can look overwhelming — but once you understand the purpose of each file, everything becomes much easier to navigate.

Let’s break it down from the bottom to the top.

---

## **1. `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript Configuration**

This file controls how TypeScript behaves in your project.
It defines:

* What should be type-checked
* What should be ignored
* Which TypeScript rules and compiler options to follow

You’ll rarely modify this heavily, but it’s essential for proper type safety.

---

## **2. `README.md` — Project Documentation**

A simple Markdown file that explains:

* How to run the project
* Available commands
* Any relevant notes for contributors

This is especially important when others collaborate with you.

---

## **3. `postcss.config.mjs` — PostCSS Configuration**

Next.js uses **PostCSS** under the hood, and this config file tells it which plugins to apply.

You’ll likely see:

```js
plugins: {
  tailwindcss: {},
  autoprefixer: {},
}
```

This is how Tailwind CSS gets integrated into your project.

---

## **4. `package-lock.json` — Dependency Lock File**

This file ensures every team member — and every deployment environment — uses the **exact same dependency versions**.

It locks:

* Dependencies
* Sub-dependencies
* Nested versions

This prevents “but it works on my machine” problems.

---

## **5. `package.json` — Core Project Manifest**

This is one of the most important files in any JavaScript project. It defines:

### ✔ Project metadata

* Name
* Version
* Private/public status

### ✔ Scripts

For example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```

### ✔ Dependencies

Everything your app needs to run, including:

* `next`
* `react`
* `react-dom`
* Tailwind CSS (if used)
* TypeScript typings

### ✔ Dev dependencies

Used only during development.

---

## **6. `next-env.d.ts` — Next.js TypeScript Declarations**

This file should **not be edited**.

It simply enables TypeScript support for Next.js features behind the scenes.

---

## **7. `next.config.ts` — Next.js Configuration**

One of the most important configuration files in a Next.js 16 project.

You can configure:

* Experimental features (like the new TurboPack FS cache)
* Image optimization settings
* Build options
* Routing behavior
* Environment variables

This is where you enable features like:

```ts
experimental: {
  turbo: {
    dev: {
      filesystemCache: true
    }
  }
}
```

---

## **8. `.eslintrc.json` (or similar) — ESLint Configuration**

Contains rules that help maintain clean, consistent, error-free code.

---

## **9. `.gitignore` — Ignore Certain Files in Git**

Prevents unnecessary or heavy files from being pushed to GitHub, such as:

* `node_modules/`
* `.next/`
* environment files
* build artifacts

This keeps your repository clean and fast.

---

## **10. `public/` — Static Assets Folder**

Everything inside this folder is publicly accessible at runtime.

Use it for:

* Images
* Fonts
* Icons
* Static files

For example:

`public/logo.png` → accessed via `/logo.png`

---

## **11. `node_modules/` — Installed Dependencies**

Often called:

> **The heaviest object in the universe.**

It contains all the packages your project depends on.
You almost never need to open it — and it’s usually hidden in editors.

---

## **12. `app/` — The Heart of a Next.js App**

This is where your actual application lives.

Inside the `app` folder, you’ll define:

* Routes
* Layouts
* Pages
* Server components
* API endpoints (in the new App Router structure)

This folder replaces the older `pages/` folder from previous versions of Next.js.

We’ll explore this folder in detail next.

## **Conclusion**

The Next.js project structure may seem overwhelming at first, but each file has a clear purpose. Understanding these core pieces helps you feel confident navigating and customizing your app as it grows.
