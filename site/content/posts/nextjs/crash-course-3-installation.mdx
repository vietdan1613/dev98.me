Getting started with Next.js has never been easier. Whether you're new to the framework or setting up a fresh project, this guide walks you through everything—from installation to configuring TypeScript, linting, and project structure.

Let’s dive in!

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before running Next.js, make sure your system meets the minimum requirements:

* **Node.js:** v20.9 or higher
* **Operating systems:** macOS, Windows (including WSL), Linux

### Supported Browsers

Next.js supports modern browsers with zero configuration:

* Chrome 111+
* Edge 111+
* Firefox 111+
* Safari 16.4+

## 🧱 Installation: Create Your First Next.js App

The fastest way to spin up a new Next.js project is by using **create-next-app**, a command-line tool that automatically sets up your development environment.

### **Quick Start**

Example using **pnpm**:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --yes
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

> 💡 The `--yes` flag skips all prompts and uses recommended defaults (TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router, Turbopack, and alias `@/*`).

## ⚙️ Create a Project Using the CLI

Run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

You’ll see interactive prompts like:

```
What is your project named? my-app  
Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults?
```

Choosing **“Customize”** lets you select:

* TypeScript or JavaScript
* ESLint, Biome, or no linter
* Tailwind CSS
* React Compiler
* App Router
* src directory
* Custom import alias

After completing the setup, create-next-app generates your project folder and installs all dependencies automatically.

## ▶️ Run the Development Server

Start your project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Edit `app/page.tsx`—your browser auto-refreshes with updates.
