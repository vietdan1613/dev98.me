In this guide, we’ll walk through installing **Next.js 16**—the modern React framework used by some of the world’s largest companies to build fast, high-quality web applications.

We’ll also take a quick look at WebStorm and a new Next.js 16 feature that can speed up your development workflow.

Let’s get started.

---

## **1. Tools You Can Use (Optional but Recommended)**

### **WebStorm IDE**

Throughout this demo, WebStorm is used as the main editor. It's a powerful JavaScript & TypeScript IDE and is now **free for non-commercial use**, making it an excellent option for everyday developers.

If you'd like to use it, download it using the link provided with your course or documentation.

### **Juni – Smart Coding Agent**

WebStorm also supports **Juni**, an AI-powered coding assistant.
Juni can:

* Answer your coding questions
* Help with code generation
* Boost your productivity

You’ll see examples of this throughout the project, but it's entirely optional.

---

## **2. Create a New Project Folder**

To keep everything clean, start by creating an empty project.

If you’re using WebStorm:

* Create a new project
* Name it **Next.js Demo**
* Select **TypeScript**
* Click **Create**

WebStorm also allows you to auto-generate a Next.js project, but for consistency, we’ll use the official CLI command so everyone can follow the same steps.

---

## **3. Install Next.js Using the CLI**

Open your terminal inside the project folder.

Run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ./
```

(That `./` tells the installer to generate the project in your current folder.)

Before running this, you may need to delete the boilerplate files or the default `src` folder that WebStorm creates so you start with a completely empty directory.

Once you execute the command, the installer may download a few required packages for the scaffolding process.

---

## **4. Choose Installation Options**

You will see the message:

> **Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults?**

For this demo, choose:

### ✔ **Recommended Defaults**

This includes:

* TypeScript
* ESLint
* Tailwind CSS
* App Router
* TurboPack (the new default bundler)

You *can* customize these choices, but the defaults are perfectly optimized for most projects—and exactly what we’ll be using.

---

## **5. What Gets Installed?**

Next.js installs only a few core dependencies:

### **Dependencies**

* `next`
* `react`
* `react-dom`

### **Dev Dependencies**

* TypeScript + type definitions
* ESLint
* Tailwind CSS + config files

Within a few seconds, your project structure will appear in your editor.

---

## **6. (Optional but Recommended) Enable TurboPack File System Caching**

Next.js 16 introduces **TurboPack file system caching**, which dramatically speeds up:

* cold starts
* rebuild time after restarting dev server
* compilation for large projects

Vercel uses this internally, and you can easily enable it too.

Open **next.config.ts** or **next.config.js** and add:

```js
experimental: {
  turbo: {
    dev: {
      filesystemCache: true
    }
  }
}
```

This simple change can noticeably improve your development flow.
(Some editors may not recognize the word “TurboPack” yet—just add it to your dictionary if needed.)

---

## **7. You’re Ready to Run Your App**

From here, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js 16 app is now installed, configured, and ready for coding.

---

## **What’s Next?**

In the upcoming lessons, you’ll learn:

* How file routing works in the App Router
* How to use layouts, pages, and server components
* How to render content (SSR, SSG, CSR)
* How TurboPack improves performance
* How caching works in Next.js 16

We’re finally ready to dive into real code—so get your fingers warmed up!
