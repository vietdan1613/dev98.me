A common misunderstanding around Next.js has become clear: **Next.js is often misused as a full backend**, and that creates serious architectural problems.

The issue isn’t performance quirks or file-based routing—it’s **identity**.

### The Core Problem

As tooling evolved, many teams started treating backends as optional. When Next.js gained popularity, it was quickly pushed into replacing proper APIs, turning it into an all-in-one “full-stack” solution. This works for demos and MVPs—but at scale, it becomes an **anti-pattern**.

Backend systems still need:

* authentication & authorization
* logging, testing, monitoring
* API versioning, rate limiting
* background jobs, messaging, websockets
* migrations, security, auditing

Next.js simply isn’t built to handle these concerns well.

### APIs Matter — and Next.js Isn’t One

Next.js provides only a minimal server layer. Middleware is limited, composition is weak, and core backend features are missing. Mature frameworks like NestJS, Adonis, Rails, Django, Phoenix, Go, or Rust exist precisely to solve these problems—and they do it better.

This isn’t a failure of Next.js. **It was never meant to be a full backend.**

### What Next.js Is Actually Great At: BFF

Next.js excels as a **Backend-For-Frontend (BFF)**.

A BFF is a thin backend designed specifically to serve one client. Its job is not to own business logic, but to:

* aggregate data from multiple services
* normalize responses for the UI
* handle authentication securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies)
* manage CORS, tokens, and secrets
* adapt APIs without leaking complexity to the frontend

In this role, Next.js shines.

### When a BFF Makes Sense

Use a BFF if:

* one frontend talks to many services
* APIs are inconsistent or “messy”
* security concerns shouldn’t live in the client
* you want UI-specific data shaping

Avoid it if:

* you have multiple clients sharing one API
* you don’t need UI-specific orchestration

### The Takeaway

* **Don’t build serious backends in Next.js**
* **Do use Next.js as a BFF**
* Pair it with a real API designed for scale
* Stop overloading Next.js with responsibilities it wasn’t designed for
