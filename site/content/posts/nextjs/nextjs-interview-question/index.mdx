## üöÄ **Core Next.js Concepts**

1. **What are the differences between `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getInitialProps`?**  
   When would you use each?

2. **Explain the difference between static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js.**

3. **What is Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)?**  
   How does it work under the hood, and when is it useful?

4. **How does routing work in Next.js?**  
   How do dynamic routes, catch-all routes, and optional catch-all routes behave?

5. **How do you prefetch pages in Next.js and improve perceived performance?**

---

## üß± **App Router (Next 13/14+)**

1. **What‚Äôs the difference between the Pages Router and the new App Router?**

2. **How do `layout.js`, `page.js`, and `loading.js` work in the App Router?**

3. **How do you manage metadata (`<head>`) in the new App Router with `metadata` export?**

4. **How is routing and nested layouts handled differently in the App Router vs Pages Router?**

5. **Explain the concept of server and client components in the App Router.**  
   When should you make a component `use client`?

---

## üåê **Data Fetching & API Integration**

1. **How does data fetching differ between client and server components?**

2. **How would you fetch and cache data using `useSWR` or React Query in a Next.js app?**

3. **What are the trade-offs between fetching on the server vs client in terms of performance and UX?**

4. **How do you handle sensitive tokens or credentials when calling APIs in Next.js?**

5. **Explain how Next.js API routes work.**  
   How would you secure them?

---

## ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**

1. **How does Next.js optimize performance out of the box?**

2. **What is the Image Optimization API?**  
   How would you use the `next/image` component?

3. **How does Next.js handle code splitting and lazy loading?**

4. **How do you analyze and reduce bundle size in a Next.js application?**

5. **How do you handle large lists/pages with pagination or infinite scroll efficiently in Next.js?**

---

## üîê **Authentication & Authorization**

1. **How would you implement authentication in a Next.js app?**  
   Using NextAuth, Clerk, custom JWT-based, etc.

2. **How would you protect both client and server routes in a secure way?**

3. **How do middleware functions work in Next.js 13+?**  
   What are their limitations and use cases?

4. **How do you persist authentication across client and server renders?**

---

## üõ† **Dev Experience & Tooling**

1. **What is Middleware in Next.js, and how do you use it for redirects, AB testing, or auth?**

2. **How would you handle internationalization (i18n) in a Next.js app?**

3. **How do you customize the build and webpack configuration in Next.js?**

4. **How would you implement error boundaries and error handling in both page and layout-levels?**

5. **How do you configure custom document (`_document.js`) and app (`_app.js`) files? What are they for?**

---

## üß© **Architecture & Strategy**

1. **How do you structure a large-scale project using Next.js?**  
   Folder structure, feature-based architecture, etc.

2. **How do you approach SEO and social sharing optimization in Next.js?**

3. **What challenges have you faced migrating from CRA or other frameworks to Next.js?**

4. **How would you architect a dashboard with authentication, role-based access, and dynamic routing in Next.js?**

5. **How do you deploy a Next.js app to Vercel vs other providers like AWS, Netlify, or Docker?**

---

## üß† Bonus: Hands-On Questions

These are the type of problems you might be asked to **code live or explain your thought process**:

- Build a product detail page with SSG and dynamic routes.
- Implement a blog using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.
- Create a secure server-side rendered dashboard that checks user roles.
- Add a custom loading spinner that only shows on route change (App Router).
- Use middleware to redirect unauthenticated users away from `/admin`.

### ‚úÖ Want to Practice?

I can help you with:

- A **mock Next.js system design round**
- Code-throughs of **App Router and server/client component patterns**
- A small **project-based challenge** like building a blog, admin dashboard, or auth flow

Let me know which direction you want to take ‚Äî or if you want all of them bundled for prep!
